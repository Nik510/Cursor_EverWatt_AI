# Engineering Academy pilot runbook (2 weeks)

Goal: validate that Level 1 creates real confidence and reduces vendor dependence, before investing in SSO and more levels.

## Cohort
- 1 design-partner hospital
- 2–3 engineers (mix of experience levels if possible)

## Timeline

### Week 0 (prep)
- Confirm cohort roster + emails
- Send invites (Engineering Academy portal)
- Confirm course is published and certificate is configured

### Week 1 (run)
- Kickoff (30 min):
  - why the Academy exists (reduce vendor dependency)
  - safety-first expectations
  - how to give feedback per lesson
- Participants complete Modules 1–3

### Week 2 (run)
- Participants complete Modules 4–6 + assessment
- Closeout (30–45 min):
  - what was most useful?
  - what felt missing?
  - which cheat sheets would you print or bookmark?

## What to measure
- Completion rate (course + per module)
- Pass rate + retakes
- “Would you recommend to a colleague?” (0–10)
- Top 3 pain points addressed
- Anecdotes: “vendor call avoided” / “issue diagnosed faster”

## Feedback prompts (copy/paste)
- “What did you expect to learn that wasn’t covered?”
- “Which part felt too theoretical?”
- “Which playbook would you use first on a real shift?”
- “What would make this safer to apply at your facility?”

## Decision gates
- If completion < 50%: shorten Level 1 and increase cheat sheet density.
- If pass rate < 60%: adjust quiz questions to match content and add scenario explanations.
- If engineers share links internally: you’re on the right track—add more playbooks next.
