# Volume 2 — Controls & Sequences (Healthcare)

Goal: understand how intent (setpoints + sequences) becomes behavior (trends + outcomes).

## Outcomes
- Interpret command/status/feedback semantics correctly
- Recognize unstable loops (hunting) and common causes
- Evaluate resets and deadbands for comfort and energy impact
- Build evidence packs for vendors (point lists, sequences, trend sets)

## Modules (draft)
1) Point semantics: command vs status vs feedback; physical vs calculated
2) Resets: SAT, static pressure, CHW, HW — what good looks like
3) Deadbands and fighting — zone/AHU/plant coordination
4) Stability basics — hunting signatures, limits, tuning guardrails
5) Overrides — safe usage, rollback, and “audit trail” habits

## Standard “trend sets” (seed)
- AHU: SAT/SP setpoint vs actual, damper positions, fan speed, MAT/RAT/OAT
- VAV: airflow cmd/act, reheat cmd/act, discharge temp, zone temp
- Plant: LCHW setpoint/actual, pump speeds, valve positions, staging states
