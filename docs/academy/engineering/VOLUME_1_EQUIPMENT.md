# Volume 1 — Equipment & System Behavior (Healthcare)

Goal: build the mental model needed to troubleshoot safely and accurately.

## Outcomes
- Explain plant → airside → zone interactions and how changes propagate
- Identify “normal” operation vs constraints vs faults
- Understand what common sensors/actuators mean and how they fail

## Modules (draft)
1) Plant basics (chillers/boilers/pumps/towers) — what’s normal, what’s not
2) AHUs and OA/RA/EA paths — what dampers/coils/fans are doing
3) VAV terminals + reheat — how zones actually get comfortable
4) Sensors and instrumentation — failure modes, placement pitfalls, trust hierarchy

## “Normal Operation” checklists (seed)
- Chiller plant: staging, leaving CHW stability, ΔT sanity checks
- AHU: OA fraction plausibility, SAT stability, fan/VFD behavior
- Zone: discharge temp vs valve, reheat patterns, schedule alignment
