# Overnight runtime creep / scheduling drift

## Who this is for
- Role(s): Facilities engineer / energy manager

## Safety & constraints (must read)
- Confirm intended schedules with stakeholders (clinical + ops) before changes
- Timebox any overrides

## Symptom(s)
- Equipment runs outside intended hours
- Start/stop times drift over weeks

## Likely causes (ranked)
1) Overrides left in place  
2) Holiday schedules missing  
3) Optimum start/stop misconfigured  
4) Operator workarounds  

## What to check (fast triage)
- Active overrides and manual modes
- Holiday calendar coverage
- Optimum start/stop parameters and how they behave in mild weather

## Fix / Mitigation steps (lowest risk first)
- Clear overrides and document
- Add holiday schedules and test

## Verification
- Runtime aligns with intended schedule for a full week
