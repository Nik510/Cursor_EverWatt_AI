        "The regulatory pivot to Total System Benefit (TSB) and NMEC has fundamentally changed the incentives. The market is now driven to find not just any energy savings, but valuable energy savings-those that occur during summer peaks and contribute to grid reliability. For customers, this means access to more specialized expertise (e.g., a hospital talking to a healthcare energy expert rather than a general utility rep) and more flexible performance-based incentives. For the grid, it promises a more reliable, responsive demand side resource that can be verified at the meter.",
        "The success of this portfolio relies on the effective coordination between these diverse third parties and the core utility functions. With financing mechanisms like On-Bill Financing serving as the lubricant for capital projects, and Statewide Upstream programs handling the volume of equipment sales, the structure is designed to attack barriers to efficiency from multiple angles simultaneously."
