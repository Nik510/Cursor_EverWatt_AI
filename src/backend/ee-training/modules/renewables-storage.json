                "question": "For many commercial customers, what bill component often makes batteries valuable?",
                "options": ["Color temperature", "Demand charges and TOU peaks", "Window U-factor", "Boiler turndown"],
                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "Batteries often pay by reducing demand charges and shifting energy away from high TOU periods.",

                "correctAnswer": 2,
                "explanation": "Many commercial battery systems are roughly ~85–92% round-trip efficient depending on equipment and operating range.",

                "options": ["It increases loads", "It reduces required system size and improves ROI", "It eliminates tariffs", "It guarantees interconnection"],
                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "Efficiency reduces baseline usage and peaks, allowing smaller PV/storage and better economics.",
