How you stage (bring on/off) equipment significantly impacts efficiency.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### 1. Run Fewer Units at Higher Load\n- Most equipment is more efficient at 70-90% load than 30% load\n- Two chillers at 40% < one chiller at 80%\n\n### 2. Stage Early, Unstage Late\n- Prevent cycling by adding hysteresis (dead band)\n- Stage up at 90% capacity, unstage at 60%\n\n### 3. Lead-Lag Rotation\n- Rotate lead equipment to equalize runtime\n- Prevents premature wear on one unit\n\n### 4. Consider Part-Load Efficiency\n- VFD-equipped units often have better part-load efficiency\n- May want to prioritize VFD units at low loads"

Unlike a shiny new chiller, optimized controls don't look different.\n\n## Keys to Success\n\n### 1. Quantify the Waste\n- Show the energy going to unnecessary heating/cooling\n- Calculate the cost of running full speed when part load would suffice\n- Use trend data or temporary logging if needed\n\n### 2. Bundle with Hardware\n- VFDs + reset programming\n- Sensors + DCV logic\n- Makes project more tangible and OBF-eligible\n\n### 3. Offer Guarantees\n- Performance-based contract: We guarantee X% savings\n- Builds confidence for skeptical owners\n\n### 4. Start Small\n- Pilot project on one AHU or zone\n- Prove value, then expand"

We use a measured approach - small changes, verify comfort, then adjust. We can always roll back.\"*\n\n### \"It's not worth the hassle for just a few percent\"\n*\"Let me show you the numbers. On a building spending $500K/year on energy, 10% is $50K/year - every year. That adds up quickly.\"*\n\n### \"We don't have the staff to maintain it\"\n*\"That's a fair concern.
