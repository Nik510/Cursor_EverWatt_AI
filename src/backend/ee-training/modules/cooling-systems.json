These systems include chillers (water-cooled and air-cooled), cooling towers, chilled water pumps, and distribution piping.\n\n## Energy Impact\n\n**Cooling typically accounts for 30-50% of a commercial building's energy consumption**, making it the largest opportunity for energy savings. A typical 500-ton chiller system in a 200,000 sq ft office building costs $100,000-150,000/year to operate.\n\n## The Business Case\n\n- 1% improvement in chiller efficiency = $1,000-$5,000/year savings\n- Typical optimization projects save 15-30% = $15,000-$45,000/year\n- VFD tower fan retrofit: 2-year payback\n- Lift optimization: Immediate savings (zero capital cost)"

It takes heat from inside the building and pumps it outside. The harder it has to work to do that - the bigger the temperature difference - the more electricity it uses.\"\n\n## The Money Connection\n\n**Pitch script:**\n\n\"Right now your chiller is working against a 43-degree temperature difference. That's like pushing water uphill. If we reduce that difference by 10 degrees, we cut your compressor power by 20%. On your 500-ton system, that's $24,000 per year.\"\n\n## Objection Handler\n\n**\"That sounds too good to be true\"**\n\n\"It's physics, not magic. Every textbook and manufacturer will tell you the same thing. We're not selling you equipment - we're optimizing what you already have. Let me show you the settings on your chiller right now and calculate the exact savings.\""

That's 43 degrees of lift.\n\nHere's the physics: Every degree we reduce that lift saves 2% energy.\n\nIf we raise your chilled water to 46°F and lower your condenser to 78°F, we get 32 degrees of lift. That's 11 degrees less = 22% savings.\n\nOn your 500-ton system running 2,000 hours, that's about $28,000 per year. And it costs nothing - just setpoint changes.\"\n\n## Handling Objections\n\n**\"We need 42°F water\"**\n→ \"For what specifically? Most comfort cooling works fine at 46-48°F. Process loads might need colder water, but we can split the loop.\"\n\n**\"Our engineer set it that way for a reason\"**\n→ \"Absolutely - 42°F is the safe default. But ASHRAE allows up to 48°F for comfort cooling. We'll raise it gradually and monitor comfort. If there's any issue, we go back.\"\n\n**\"That sounds too simple\"**\n→ \"It is simple - and that's why it's often overlooked. Most energy auditors focus on equipment replacement.

It takes 10 minutes.\"\n\n**The Reveal:**\n[At BMS or chiller controls]\n\"Right now you're making 42°F water and rejecting heat at 85°F. That's a 43-degree lift. Your chiller has to work against that entire temperature difference.\n\nHere's the physics: Every degree we reduce that lift saves about 2% energy.\n\nIf we raise your chilled water to 46°F - which is fine for comfort cooling - and lower your condenser water to 78°F, we get 32 degrees of lift. That's 11 degrees less.\n\n11 degrees × 2% = 22% savings. On your 500-ton system running 2,000 hours, that's about $28,000 per year.\"\n\n**The Close:**\n\"Want to try it? We can raise it 1 degree per week and monitor comfort. If anyone complains, we back off. But I've done this a hundred times and 90% of buildings can handle 46-48°F just fine.\""

Here's why...\"\n\n**The Reveal:**\n\"Right now your fans run at 100% speed all the time. But you only need that on the hottest days. Most of the time, 50-60% speed is plenty.\n\nHere's the magic: Fan power drops with the cube of speed. If you run at 50% speed, you use only 12.5% of the power. That's an 87.5% reduction in fan energy.\n\n[Pull out calculator]\nYour two 25 HP fans run about 2,000 hours a year. At full speed, that's $9,000/year in electricity. With VFDs averaging 60% speed, it drops to $2,000. That's $7,000 saved on fans alone.\n\nBut here's the bonus: Running the fans longer at lower speed gives you colder condenser water. 78°F instead of 85°F. That saves another 10% on your chiller - about $7,000 more.\n\nTotal savings: $14,000/year. VFD cost: about $18,000 installed. Payback: 15 months.\"\n\n**The Close:**\n\"This is the single best ROI upgrade in a chiller plant. Under two years and you're making money. Want me to write this up as a proposal?\""

Here's what we'll do: We'll raise it 1°F per week and monitor space temps. If anyone complains - and I mean actually complains to facilities, not just adjusts their personal fan - we back off.\n\nIn my experience, 90% of buildings can handle 46-48°F with no issues. The other 10% can usually get to 44-45°F. Either way, you save money.\n\nWorst case? We go back to 42°F and you're no worse off. Best case? 8% annual savings forever.\"\n\n## \"We don't have budget for a chiller replacement\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"I'm not suggesting you replace your chiller - at least not yet. Let's optimize what you have first. The lift reduction I showed you costs nothing. VFD fans pay for themselves in 18 months.\n\nAfter we've squeezed everything out of your existing system, then we can talk about whether a chiller replacement makes sense. For most buildings, optimization delivers 70-80% of the savings at 10-20% of the cost.\"\n\n## \"Our engineer designed it this way for a reason\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"Absolutely - your engineer designed a robust system that works. But engineers are conservative by nature, and 42°F is the safe default.\n\nASHRAE actually allows up to 48°F for comfort cooling. We're not doing anything outside industry standards - just optimizing within the acceptable range.\n\nPlus, equipment and controls have improved since your system was designed. What wasn't possible 10 years ago is now standard practice. I'd be happy to walk your engineer through the technical basis.\"\n\n## \"That sounds too good to be true\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"I get that. Let me show you the physics - this isn't magic.\n\n[Draw P-h diagram or show lift calculation]\n\nEvery thermodynamics textbook confirms this: Lower lift = less compressor work. Carrier, Trane, Daikin - they all publish curves showing this.\n\nThe reason most people don't know about it is that it requires understanding the system as a whole, not just individual components. Most energy auditors focus on lighting and plug loads because they're simpler. We focus on where the real energy is.\""
