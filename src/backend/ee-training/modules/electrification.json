The goal: eliminate on-site combustion.\n\n## Why Now?\n\n### 1. Climate Mandates\n- California: All-electric new construction codes (Title 24)\n- NYC: Local Law 97 requires 40% emissions reduction by 2030\n- Many cities banning gas in new buildings\n\n### 2. Grid Decarbonization\n- Electric grid is getting cleaner every year\n- California: 60%+ renewable by 2030\n- Electric heat pumps: 2-4x more efficient than resistance\n\n### 3. Technology Advancement\n- Cold-climate heat pumps work to -15°F\n- VRF systems offer precise zone control\n- Heat pump water heaters are mainstream"
