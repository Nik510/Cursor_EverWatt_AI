Which facades?\n- Any condensation or moisture issues?\n- Are doors/hatches hard to close (pressure/stack effect)?\n- Are you planning HVAC replacement soon (downsizing opportunity)?\n\n### Objection handling\n| Objection | Response |\n|---|---|\n| \"Savings are hard to prove\" | \"We start with air sealing and targeted measures, and we use before/after comfort + runtime + utility data.\" |\n| \"Too disruptive\" | \"We begin with low-disruption: air sealing, films, roof improvements—then phase larger work.\" |\n| \"We want HVAC first\" | \"Envelope reduces load so HVAC can be smaller and cheaper. Doing envelope first protects the HVAC investment.\" |"
