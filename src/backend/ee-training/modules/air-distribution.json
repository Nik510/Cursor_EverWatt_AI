But actual occupancy is usually 30-70% of design. Constant ventilation at design rates:\n- Wastes energy conditioning unused OA\n- Overcools/overheats during low occupancy\n- Increases peak demand\n\n## The Solution: CO2-Based DCV\n\nCO2 is a proxy for occupancy (people generate ~0.01 CFM CO2). By monitoring CO2, we can modulate OA to actual need.\n\n**Target CO2 Levels**:\n- Outdoor: ~400 ppm\n- Good indoor: 600-800 ppm\n- ASHRAE acceptable: < 1,000 ppm above outdoor\n- Stuffy/complaint level: > 1,200 ppm"

The AHU supplies cool air (typically 55°F), and each zone modulates its VAV box damper to get more or less air.\n\n## Why VAV?\n\n**Energy Savings**: When zone load drops, airflow drops. Fan energy savings via affinity laws.\n\n**Individual Control**: Each zone can call for its own amount of cooling.\n\n**Reheat Reduction**: Only zones that need it get reheat (vs. terminal reheat in CAV).\n\n## VAV Box Types\n\n### Cooling-Only VAV\nSimplest type. Damper modulates from minimum to maximum. No reheat.\n\n### VAV with Reheat\nDamper modulates + hot water or electric reheat coil. For interior and perimeter zones.\n\n### Fan-Powered VAV (Parallel)\nLocal fan draws return air plenum into box. Reduces primary air at part load. Good for perimeter zones.\n\n### Fan-Powered VAV (Series)\nLocal fan in series with primary air. Constant airflow to zone, variable primary air. Used for tight control."

Minimum Airflow Reduction\nMany VAV boxes have minimums set too high. Review ASHRAE 62.1 for actual requirements.\n- **Savings**: 10-20% reheat\n- **Common issue**: 50% minimum was historical standard; 20-30% is often acceptable\n\n### 4.
