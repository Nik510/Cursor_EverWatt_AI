These systems include boilers (hot water and steam), furnaces, heat pumps, and hydronic distribution.\n\n## Energy Impact\n\n**Heating typically accounts for 20-40% of a commercial building's energy consumption** in heating-dominant climates. Natural gas is the primary fuel, making these systems major targets for electrification.\n\n## The Business Case\n\n- Condensing boiler upgrade: 10-15% gas savings\n- Boiler tune-up: 2-5% immediate savings (low cost)\n- Heat pump conversion: 50-70% energy savings (but fuel switch)\n- Steam trap repair: $500-5,000/year per failed trap"
