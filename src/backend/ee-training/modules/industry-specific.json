(Affects lighting, HVAC scheduling)\n2. **Peak Demand:** Do you have high demand charges? (Affects battery storage, load shifting)\n3. **Equipment Age:** How old are major systems? (HVAC, lighting, process equipment)\n4. **Controls:** Do you have energy management systems or controls? (Scheduling, occupancy, etc.)\n5. **Maintenance:** What's your maintenance budget? (Energy efficiency can reduce maintenance)\n6. **Comfort Issues:** Are there comfort complaints? (Often indicates inefficiency)\n7. **Future Plans:** Are there planned renovations or expansions? (Opportunity to bundle improvements)\n8. **Utility Programs:** Are you aware of utility rebates/programs? (Can improve ROI)"
