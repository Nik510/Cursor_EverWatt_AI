          "content": "## Why recirc is often the biggest lever\n\nRecirc keeps hot water near fixtures to reduce wait time. But if it runs continuously, it turns your piping into a radiator.\n\n### Control strategies\n- **Time schedules** (turn off at night/weekends)\n- **Temperature (aquastat) control** (maintain a return temp band)\n- **Demand control** (button/sensor triggers pump for short bursts)\n\n### Field symptoms of waste\n- Warm/hot return piping everywhere\n- Pump running 24/7\n- High return temperatures even during unoccupied hours\n\n**Sales translation:** controls are low disruption and often pay back quickly."
