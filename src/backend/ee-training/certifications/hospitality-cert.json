      "questionType": "scenario",
      "scenario": "A hotel has 200 guest rooms, each with a PTAC (Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner) unit. The units run continuously, even when rooms are unoccupied. Guests often leave windows open while units run.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Installing occupancy-based controls (sensors, keycard switches) can reduce guest room HVAC energy by 20-40%. Guest education on proper operation (closing windows, using controls) can provide additional savings. This is typically more cost-effective than replacing all units or installing central systems.",

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "All measures are valuable. Installing a VFD and scheduling controls can reduce pump energy by 50-70%. Pool covers can reduce heating energy by 20-40%. A combination of measures provides the best results.",
