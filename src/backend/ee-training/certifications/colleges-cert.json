      "question": "A community college has a welding program with 10 welding stations. The exhaust system runs continuously. What efficiency opportunity exists?",
      "questionType": "scenario",
      "scenario": "A community college welding lab has 10 welding stations. Each station has local exhaust ventilation (1,000 CFM). The exhaust system runs continuously, even when classes are not in session (approximately 20 hours/week of actual use).",

        { "id": "d", "text": "No changes - safety requires constant exhaust" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Installing scheduling controls to reduce exhaust during non-class hours can reduce ventilation energy by 50-70% (from 168 hours/week to 20 hours/week). This maintains safety during class hours while eliminating waste during unoccupied periods. This is typically the highest-impact measure for vocational facilities.",
