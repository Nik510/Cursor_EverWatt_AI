      "question": "A university has a central chilled water plant serving 20 buildings. The chillers run at full capacity year-round. What is the most impactful optimization?",
      "questionType": "scenario",
      "scenario": "A university central plant has three 1,000-ton chillers that run continuously. The plant serves 20 buildings across campus. Chilled water demand varies significantly by season and time of day, but the plant operates at full capacity regardless of load.",
