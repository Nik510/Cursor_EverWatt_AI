      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "PUE = Total Facility Power / IT Equipment Power. 2.0 = Total / 500 kW. Total = 2.0 × 500 = 1,000 kW. This means 500 kW goes to IT equipment and 500 kW goes to cooling, UPS, lighting, etc. Reducing PUE to 1.5 would reduce total power to 750 kW (saving 250 kW).",
