      "questionType": "scenario",
      "scenario": "An office building's chiller runs continuously, but the building is only occupied Monday-Friday, 7 AM - 5 PM (10 hours/day). The chiller runs at full capacity even during unoccupied periods, weekends, and holidays.",

      "explanation": "Installing scheduling controls and implementing night/weekend setback can reduce HVAC energy by 20-40%. This addresses the specific issue of 24/7 operation when the building is only occupied 10 hours/day. Scheduling is typically the fastest payback measure for office buildings.",

      "explanation": "Upgrading single-pane windows to double-pane low-E windows can reduce overall building energy by 10-20%. This addresses both heating and cooling loads and improves comfort. However, window replacement is capital-intensive, so it's often combined with other envelope improvements.",
