      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Private schools often have more flexibility in decision-making due to tuition-based funding and may have different budget priorities than public schools. They may also have access to different utility programs. However, they still face budget constraints and benefit from energy efficiency.",

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Private schools often have specialized spaces (chapels, auditoriums) where aesthetics are important. LED replacements that maintain or enhance the aesthetic quality while reducing energy (40-65% savings) are the best approach. Modern LEDs can replicate warm, decorative lighting while providing significant energy savings.",
