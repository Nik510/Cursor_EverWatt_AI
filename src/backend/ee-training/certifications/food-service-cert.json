      "question": "A restaurant has exhaust hoods that run at full speed continuously during operating hours. What efficiency opportunity exists?",
      "questionType": "scenario",
      "scenario": "A restaurant has two exhaust hoods (Type I) that run at full speed continuously from 11 AM to 10 PM (11 hours/day). The hoods operate at full speed even during low-cooking periods.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Installing variable-speed controls (VFDs) on exhaust hood fans can reduce ventilation energy by 30-50% by reducing fan speed during low-cooking periods. This addresses the specific issue of continuous full-speed operation. Heat recovery is also valuable but requires more capital investment.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Refrigeration optimization (door gaskets, defrost schedules, temperature setpoints, evaporator fan controls) can reduce refrigeration energy by 15-30%. This is typically more cost-effective than replacing all equipment and provides faster payback.",
