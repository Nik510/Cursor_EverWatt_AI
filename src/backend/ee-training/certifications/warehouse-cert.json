      "explanation": "Open dock doors cause significant HVAC energy waste, especially in extreme climates (hot summers, cold winters). Installing dock door seals, high-speed doors, or dock shelters can reduce this waste. In some cases, minimal HVAC (spot heating/cooling) may be more appropriate than conditioning the entire space.",
