New: 200 × 15W = 3,000W = 3 kW × 14 hrs × 365 days = 15,330 kWh/year × $0.12 = $1,840/year. Savings: $2,084/year. Cost: 200 × $50 = $10,000. Payback: $10,000 / $2,084 = ~4.8 years.

      "explanation": "Optimizing HVAC start/stop times (optimal start/stop) can reduce HVAC energy by 10-20% by minimizing runtime while maintaining comfort. This balances energy savings with customer comfort. Complete shutdown may cause comfort issues, but reducing operation during closed hours is typically feasible.",
