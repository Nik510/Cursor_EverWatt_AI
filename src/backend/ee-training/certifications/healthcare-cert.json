      "explanation": "Installing VFDs on chiller pumps and implementing variable flow can reduce pump energy by 50-70% during low-load periods. This addresses the specific issue of the chiller running at full capacity when load is low. While replacing the chiller or adding economizers are good measures, VFDs provide the most immediate impact for this scenario.",
