# EverWatt Project Library (Phase 1)

This folder is the **durable internal knowledge base** for messy, historical EMS project artifacts.

## Layout

- `raw/<project_slug>/manifest.yaml`
  - A human-editable manifest that describes the project and lists the raw source files.
  - Put the raw artifacts (PDFs, spreadsheets, docs, images, etc.) next to the manifest.
- `normalized/<project_id>.json`
  - A canonical, **versioned**, normalized project record (validated by Zod).
  - Generated by the ingestion CLI at `src/tools/projectLibrary/ingest.ts`.

## Ingestion (Phase 1)

The ingestion tool reads `raw/*/manifest.yaml` and generates normalized JSON records. This phase is **deterministic**:

- No PDF OCR / parsing
- No vector DB embeddings
- No non-deterministic AI extraction
