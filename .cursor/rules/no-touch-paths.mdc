# Default no-touch paths

When asked for "no-touch paths", use these defaults (unless the user explicitly overrides them):

- `src/modules/tariffEngine/**`
- `src/modules/battery/**`
- `src/app/**`

## Intent

- Keep the recommendation system **additive** by default.
- Protect deterministic engines and application core from incidental edits.

## Exceptions

Only touch these paths if the user explicitly requests changes in them.
