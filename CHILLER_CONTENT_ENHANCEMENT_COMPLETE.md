## Data Structure

All enhanced content is exported as `chillerEnhancedData` and includes:
- `engineerPerspective` - Technical deep dives
- `salesPerspective` - Sales intelligence
- `deepDive` - Concept explanations

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Create `DualPerspectiveViewer` component to toggle between Engineer/Sales views
2. ⏳ Update `TechPageLayout` to display enhanced content sections
3. ⏳ Add expandable "Deep Dive" sections for each concept
4. ⏳ Apply same pattern to other technologies (Boilers, VRF, VFD, etc.)
