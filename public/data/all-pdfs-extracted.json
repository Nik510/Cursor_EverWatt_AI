Kenney   Effective   July 8, 2021  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  APPLICABILITY:   Schedule A - 10 is a demand metered rate schedule for general service customers.  Schedule A - 10 applies to single - phase and polyphase alternating - current service (for a  description of these terms, see Section D of Rule   2*). This schedule is n ot available to  residential or agricultural service for which a residential or agricultural schedule is  applicable, except for single - phase and polyphase service in common areas in a  multifamily complex (see Common - Area Accounts section).  Effective March 1 , 2021, Schedule A - 10 is available only to   qualifying solar legacy   TOU  period   customers, or to qualifying customers without interval meters that can be read  remotely by PG&E, as specified in greater detail below. This tariff is currently scheduled  to expi re in 2027,   at which time all   customers must tr ansition to new Schedule B - 10 or  other applicable new tariffs with later Time - of - Use (TOU) hours as described below. The  non - TOU version of Schedule A - 10 is not available for solar legacy   TOU   period  pur poses a fter March 2021 .  Under Rate Schedu le   A - 10, there is a limit on the demand (the number of kilowatts (kW))  the customer may require from the PG&E system. If the customer's demand exceeds  499   kW for three consecutive months, the customer's   account wil l be tr ansferred to  Sc hedule   E - 19 or E - 20 .  Effective November 1, 2014, new customers establishing service on Schedule A - 10  where a Smart Meter TM   is already in place will be charged Schedule A - 10 TOU rates.  Decision 18 - 08 - 013 adopted new TOU peri ods and sea sonal d efinitions for   all non -  residential   customer classes. Schedules A - 1, A - 6, A - 10, E - 19 and E - 20 will be retained  as legacy rate schedules with their   legacy   TOU periods until the rates with new TOU  periods (B - 1, B - 6, B - 10, B - 19 and B - 20) esta blished   in   the sam e proceeding,   become  mandatory in   March 2021 . Certain qualifying customers with solar systems will be  permitted to maintain   their existing   legacy   TOU   periods for a certain period of time, per  Decision 17 - 01 - 006, as described in the Electr ic Ru le   1, Defi nit ions : Beh ind - the - Meter  Solar   Legacy   TOU   Period   Eligibility Requirements.

The provisions of Schedule S B — Standby Service Special Conditions 1 thro u gh   6 shall also  apply to customers whose premises are regularly supplied in part (but   not   in whole) by  electric energy from a nonutility source of supply. These   customers will pay   monthly  reservation charges as specified under Section 1 of Schedule S B , i n   ad dition to all  applicable Schedule A - 10 charges. Exemptions to standby charges are outlined in the  Standby Applicability Section of this rate schedule.  Transfe rs Off of Schedule   A - 10 TOU:   Customers are placed on this schedule if they are  not eligible   fo r   Schedules A - 1 or A - 6 because their demand exceeded or was expected to  exceed 75 kW. Customers   who   then   fail to exceed   75   kilowatts for 12   consecutive months  m ay elect   to   stay on   this schedule.  Assignment of New Customers : If a customer is new and PG& E   be lieves that the  customer’s maximum demand will be between   75   through 499 kilowatts and that the  customer should not be served under an agricultural or resident ial rate schedule,   PG&E will  serve the customer’s account under the provisions of time - of - use   R at e Schedule   A - 10.  Peak Day Pricing Rates:   Peak Day Pricing (PDP) rates provide customers the opportunity  to manage their   electric costs by reducing load during high cost periods or shifting load from  high cost periods to lower cost periods.  Effective March   1, 2021, PDP rates will no longer be available in conjunction wit h this  legacy Schedule A - 10 rate option.

Decision 18 - 08 - 013 adopted new TOU periods and seasonal definitions for all non -  residential customer classes as discussed above. After the voluntary period   ends , beginning  March 2021 , new Schedule B - 10, with revised TOU periods, will become mandatory for  customers served on this rate schedule, with exceptions for solar   legacy   customers,  discussed above.  Beginning in   March 2021 , Schedule B - 10, with revised TOU periods, will become mandatory  for customers served on this schedule:  Customers on Schedule A - 10 with an interval meter and that have at least 12  months of hourly usage data available will transition to the new Schedule B - 10.  Customers on the non - TOU option of Schedule A - 10 eligible for transition to  mandatory TOU rates, including Direct Access and Community Choice  Aggregation (DA/CCA) customers, will transition to new Schedule B - 10.  The transition of customers no longer eligible for A - 10 to new B - 10 with revised TOU  periods will occur on the start of the customer’s   March 2021   billing cycle. Customers will  have at least 45 - days’ notice prior to their scheduled transition date, during which they will  continue to take service on this rate schedule. Customers may elect any applicable new rate  with revised TOU periods, based on their eligibility, up to five (5) days prior to the planned  transition date to the new Schedule B - 10.  Exemptions to mandatory transitions beginning in   March 2021   include:  Qualifying customers with solar systems who meet the requirements in Rule 1  Definition of “Behind - the - Meter Solar   Legacy   TOU Period” and the terms of  “Behind - the - Meter Solar   Legacy   TOU Period Eligibility Requirements” shall be  permitted to maintain their legacy TOU rate periods, until the date ten years after  their system received its permission to operate (but in no event beyond December  31, 2027 (for   P ublic   Agencies, as defined in Electric Rule 1 ) or July 31, 2027 (for all  other qualifying). However, rates for those TOU rate periods will be updated with  new rates as authorized in applicable PG&E rate proceedings and advice filings.  Customers that do not have a meter that is capable of billing on the new Schedules  B - 10   by the beginning of their March 2021 billing cycle , may continue service this  schedule until they receive an interval meter and have at least twelve (12) months  of hourly usage data available.  The mandatory transition process will then occur in November 2021 and in each  November thereafter to transition all applicable remaining A - 10 customers to the  rates with revised TOU periods.

Kenney   Effective   June 1, 2022  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  BASIS FOR  DEMAND  CHARGE:  The customer will be billed for demand according to the customer’s “maximum demand”  each month. The number of kW used will be recorded over 15 - minute intervals; the  highest 15 - minute average in the month will be the customer's max imum demand.  SPECIAL CASES: (1) If the customer’s use of energy is intermittent or subject to severe  fluctuations, a 5 - minute interval may be used; and (2)   If the customer uses welders, the  demand charge will be subject to the minimum demand charges for   those welders’  ratings, as explained in Section J of Rule   2.  (L)  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  DEFINITION OF  SERVICE  VOLTAGE:  The following defines the three   voltage classes of Schedule A - 10 rates. Standard  Service Voltages are listed in Rule   2, Section B.1.  a.   Second ary : This is the voltage class if the service voltage is less than 2,400   volts  or if the definitions of “primary” and “transmission” do not apply to the service.  b.   Primary : This is the voltage class if the customer is served from a “single customer  su bstation” or   without transformation   from PG&E’s serving distribution system at  one of the standard primary voltages specified in PG&E’s   Electric Rule   2, Section  B.1.  c.   Transmission : This is the voltage class if the customer is served   without  transformati on   from PG&E’s serving transmission system at one of the standard  transmission voltages specified in PG&E’s Rule   2, Section   B.1.  PG&E retains the right to change its line voltage at any time. Customers receiving  voltage discounts will get reasonable notic e of any impending change. They will then  have the option of taking service at the new voltage (and making whatever changes in  their systems are necessary) or taking service without a voltage discount through  transformers supplied by PG&E.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  CONTRACT:   For   customers who use service for only part of the year, this schedule is available only  on an annual contract.  |  |  |  SEASONS:   The summer rate is applicable May   1 through October   31, and the winter rate is  applicable   November   1 through April   30.

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES EXEMPTION:   Any customer under a  time - of - use rate schedule using electric generatio   n technology that meets the criteria as  defined in Electric Rule 1 for Distributed Energy Resources is exempt from the otherwise  applicable standby reservation charges. Customers qualifying for this exemption shall  be subject to the following requirements .   Customers qualifying for an exemption from  standby charges under Public Utilities (PU) Code Sections   353.1 and 353.3, as  described above, must take service on a time - of - use (TOU) schedule in order to receive  this exemption until a real - time pricing prog ram, as described in PU Code   353.3, is  made available. Once available, customers qualifying for the standby charge exemption  must participate in the real - time program referred to above. Qualification for and receipt  of this distributed energy resources e xemption does not exempt the customer from  metering charges applicable to time - of - use (TOU) and real - time pricing, or exempt the  customer from reasonable interconnection charges, non - bypassable charges as  required in Preliminary Statement BB   -   Competition   Transition Charge Responsibility for  All Customers and CTC Procurement , or obligations determined by the Commission to  result from participation in the purchase of power through the California Department of  Water Resources, as provided in PU Code Section   3 53.7.  SOLAR PILOT  PROGRAM:  A pilot program that increases the maximum demand limit for Schedule   A - 6 customers  from 500   kilowatts to 1,000   kilowatts is available effective January   1, 2008 for  customers tha t install a solar photovoltaic system. However,   this provision is limited to  no more than a cumulative 20   megawatts (MW) of installed solar system output, as  identified in the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Permission to Operate letter to Net  Energy Met ering customers. The change allows a customer wh   ose maximum billing  demand has been between 499 and 999   kilowatts for at least three consecutive months  during the most recent 12 - month period, or that otherwise is currently taking service, or  would be requ ired to take service, on Schedule   E - 19 on a manda tory basis, and that  installs a solar photovoltaic system that meets at least 20 percent of the measured  maximum demand, to voluntarily move to the Schedule   A - 6 tariff. Such customers will  be eligible to ta ke net energy metering service under Schedule   NEM , subject to the  terms and conditions therein. The maximum demand measurement is based on facility  load before the installation of any solar system. This expansion of Schedule   A - 6  eligibility to 999   kW sha ll apply to solar customers only.  Effective Augu st 13, 2015, new customers or additional load from existing customers  may not be added to the pilot.  Customers that participate in this pilot program may continue service on Schedule A - 6  for up to 10 years a fter their system received their permission to op   erate, but in no event  beyond December 31, 2027 (for public schools) or July 31, 2027 (for all other qualifying  customers).  Wildfire Fund  Charge  The Wildfire Fund Charge was imposed by California Public Utilities Commission  Decisions 19 - 10 - 056, 20 - 07 - 0 14, 20 - 09 - 005, and 20 - 09 - 023   and is property of  Department of Water Resour ces (DWR) for all purposes under California law. The  Charge became effective October 1, 2020, and applies to all retail sales, excluding  CARE and Medical Baseline sales. The Wildfi   re Fund Charge (where applicable) is  included in customers’ total billed a mounts.

Kenney   Effective   October 16, 2021  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  PEAK DAY  PRICING  DETAILS  a.   Default Provision :   The   default of eligible customer s   to PDP will occur once  per year with the start of their billing cycle after   November   1 . Eligible  customers will have at least 45 - day   notice prior to their planned default dat e  w hen they may op t - out of PDP rates to take servic e on TOU rates. During the  45 - day s   period, customers will continue to take service on their non - PDP rate.  Customers may elect any applicable PDP rate. However, if the customers  taking service on this sch ed ule   have not made that choice or elected to opt - ou t  to a TOU rate at least five (5) days before their proposed default date, their  service will be defaulted to the PDP version of this rate schedule on their  default date.  In March 2022, customers who   are   enrolled in the version of PDP with 5:00  p.m.   –   8:00 p.m. PDP Event Hours (5 to 8 PDP) will be transitioned to a new  version of PDP with 4:00 p.m.   –   9:00 p.m. PDP Event Hours (4 to 9 PDP).  Starting in March 2022, 5 to 8 PDP will be discontinued, and 4   to 9 PDP will be  available only on the new rates with later TOU hours.  Pursuant to a modification granted by the CPUC Executive Director by letter  dated June 14, 2021, PG&E was allowed an extension to March 2022 to default  eligible non - residential and non - agricultural customers to PDP rate plans as  requ ired by Ordering Paragraph 1 of D.10 - 02 - 032 and Ordering Paragraph 1(d)  of D.11 - 11 - 008.  Bundled service Net Energy Metering (NEM) customers taking se rv ice   on  Schedule NEM, NEMV, NEMVMASH, NEM2, NEM2V, or NEM 2VMSH are  eligible for default to PDP and to opt - in to PDP.   NEM customers on NEMBIO,  NEMFC, NEMCCSF, a nd NEMA are not eligible for PDP. The NEM An n ual  True - Up billing date, and the first year PDP   Bi ll   Stabilization date in section b  below, may be indepen dent 12 - month periods. After the first year on PDP,  NEM credits can offset PDP charges. PDP credits a nd charges will be  provided for exported gene r ation. All PDP billing for NEM customers will be  ba sed   on net usage during each 15 - minute interval.  b.   Bill   Stabilization :   PDP customers will be offered bill stabilization for the initial  twelve (12) months un less they opt - out during their initial 45 - day   period. Bill  stabilization ensures that during t he   in itial 12 - months under PDP, the customer  will not pay   more than it would have had it opted - out to the applicable TOU  rate.  If a customer terminates its parti cipation on the PDP rate prior to the initial  12 - month period expiring, the customer will recei ve   bi ll stabilization up to the  date when the customer ter minates its participation. Bill stabilization benefits  will be computed on a cumulative basis, based o n the earlier of 1) when a  customer terminate s   its participation on the PDP rate or 2) at the e nd   of   the  initial 12 - month period. Any applicable credits   will be applied to the customer’s  account on a subsequent regular bill. Bill stabilization is only av ailable one time  per customer. If a customer   un - enrolls or terminates its participation on a P DP  ra te, bill stabilization will not be offered again.

Notification Equipment : At the customer’s option and expe nse, it is  recommended, but not required that a customer provide a phone number o r  an   e - mail address to receive automated   voice, text ,   or email   notification  mess a ges of a PDP event fr om PG&E.  If a PDP event occurs, customers will be notified using one or more of the  above - men tioned systems. Receipt of such notice is the responsibili t y of   the  participating customer. PG&E will make reasonable efforts to notify  c u stomers, however it i s the customer’s responsibility to receive such notice  and to check the PG&E website to see if   a PDP event has been activated. It  is also the customer’s   r espo nsibility to maintain accurate notification contact  information. PG&E does   not guarantee the rel iability of the phone, e - mail  system, or Internet site by which the customer receives notificat ion.  PG&E may conduct notification test events once a month   to e nsure a  customer’s contact information is up - to - date. These are not actual   PDP  events and no loa d reduction is required.  d.   PG&E Website :   The customer’s actual energy usage is available at PG&E’s  “Your Account” website. This data may not match billing   qual ity data, and the  customer understands and agrees that the data posted to P G &E’s “Your  Account” w ebsite may be different from the actual   bill.  e.

The transition notification and default process are further described in the legacy  rate Schedule A - 10.  The provisions of Schedule SB — Standby Service Special Conditions 1 through 6  shall also apply to customers served under this schedule whose premises are  regularly supplied in part (but not in whole) by electric energy from a nonutility  source of supply. These customers will pay monthly reservation charges as  specified under Section 1 of Schedule SB, in addition to all applicable Schedule  B - 10 charges. Exemptions to standby charges are outlined in the Standby  Applicability Section of this rate schedule.  Eligibility for Schedule B - 10 : Under Rate Schedule B - 10, there is a limit on the  demand (the number of kilowatts (kW)) the customer may require from the PG&E  system. If the customer's demand exceeds 499 kW for three consecutive months,  the customer's account will be transferred to Schedule B - 19 or B - 20 , as applicable .  However, there is no minimum demand requirement to be served under this rate  Schedule.  Assignment of New Customers : If a customer is new and PG&E believes that  the customer’s maximum demand will be between 75 and 499 kilowatts and that  the customer should not be served under an agricultural or residential rate  schedule, PG&E will serve the customer’s account under the provisions of Rate  Schedule B - 10 .

Kenney   Effective   June 1, 2022  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  BASIS FOR  DEMAND  CHARGE:  The customer will be billed for demand according to the customer’s “maximum  demand” each month. The number of kW used will be recorded over 15 - minute  intervals; the highest 15 - minute average in the month will be the customer's  max imum demand.  SPECIAL CASES: (1) If the customer’s use of energy is intermittent or subject to  severe fluctuations, a 5 - minute interval may be used; and (2)   If the customer uses  welders, the demand charge will be subject to the minimum demand charges for  those welders’ ratings, as explained in Section J of Rule   2.  ( L )  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  DEFINITION OF  SERVICE  VOLTAGE:  The following defines the three   voltage classes of Schedule   B - 10 rates. Standard  Service Voltages are listed in Rule   2, Section B.1.  a.   Seco ndary : This is the voltage class if the service voltage is less than  2,400   volts or if the definitions of “primary” and “transmission” do not apply to  the service.  b.   Primary : This is the voltage class if the customer is served from a “single  customer   substation” or   without transformation   from PG&E’s serving  distribution system at one of the standard primary voltages specified in  PG&E’s   Electric Rule   2, Section B.1.  c.   Transmission : This is the voltage class if the customer is served   without  transforma tion   from PG&E’s serving transmission system at one of the  standard transmission voltages specified in PG&E’s Rule   2, Section   B.1.  PG&E retains the right to change its line voltage at any time. Customers receiving  voltage discounts will get reasonable not ice of any impending change. They will  then have the option of taking service at the new voltage (and making whatever  changes in their systems are necessary) or taking service without a voltage  discount through transformers supplied by PG&E.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  CONTRACT:   For customers who use service for only part of the year, this schedule is available  only on an annual contract.   |  ( L )\n\nU 39   San Francisco, California  Revised   Cal.

Common - area accounts that are  separately metered by PG&E and which took electric service from PG&E on or  prior to January   16, 2003, ha d   a one - time opportunity to return to a residential rate  schedule from April 1, 2004, to May 31, 2004, by notifying PG&E in writing. These  accounts remain eligible for service under this rate schedule if the customer did  not invoke this first   right of return.  In the event that the CPUC substantially amends any or all of PG&E’s commercial  or residential rate schedules, the Executive Council of Homeowners (ECHO) can  direct PG&E to begin an optional second right - of - return period lasting 105 days.  Newly constructed common - areas that are separately metered by PG&E and  which first took electric service from PG&E after January 16, 2003, have a one -  time opportunity to transfer to a residential rate schedule during a two - month  window that begins 14   mon ths after taking service on a commercial rate schedule.  This must be done by notifying PG&E in writing. These common - area accounts  have an additional opportunity to return to a residential schedule in the event that  ECHO directs PG&E to begin a second ri ght - of - return period.

Default Provision :   The default of eligible customer s   to PDP will occur once  per year with the start of their billing cycle after   No vember   1. Eligible customers  will have at least 45 - day   notice prior to their planned d efault date   wh en they  may op t - out of PDP rates to take service on TOU rates. During the 45 - day s  period, customers will continue to take service on their non - PDP rate.  Customers may elect any applicable PDP rate. However, if the customers  taking service on   this sche du le   have not made that choice or elected to opt - out  to a TOU rate at least five (5) days before their proposed default date, their  service will be defaulted to the PDP version of this rate schedule on their default  date.  I n March 202 2 ,   customers who are   enro lled in the   version of PDP   with   5 :00 p.m.  –   8 :00 p.m. PDP Event Hours   (5 to 8 PDP)   will be transitioned   t o a new versio n  of   PDP   with   4 :00   p.m.   –   9 :00 p.m. PDP Event Hours   (4 to 9 PDP) .  Starting in March 202 2 ,   5 to 8   PDP will be discontinued, and   4 to   9   PDP will be  available   only on the   new rates with later TOU hours .  Pursuant to a modification granted by the CPUC Executive Director by letter  dated June 14, 2021, PG&E was allowed an extension to March 2022 to default  eligible   non - residential and non - ag r icultural   customers to PDP rate plans as  required by Ordering Paragraph 1 of D.10 - 02 - 032 and Ordering Paragraph 1(d)  of D.11 - 11 - 008.  Bundled   service Net Energy Metering (NEM) customers taking ser vice   on  Schedule NEM, NEMV, NEMVMASH, NEM2, NEM2V, or NEM2VM S H are  eligible   for   default to PDP and   to   opt - in to PDP. NEM customers on NEMBIO,  NEMFC, NEMCCSF, and NE MA are not eligible for PDP. The   NEM Annual  True - Up billing date, and the first year PDP B ill   Stabi lization date in section b  below, may be independen t   12 - month periods. After the first year on PDP, NEM  credits can offset PDP charges. PDP credits and ch arges will be provided for  export ed generati on. All PDP billing for NEM customers will be b ased   on n et  usage during each 15 - minute interval.  b.   Bill Stabi l ization : PDP customers will be offered bill stabilization for the initial  twelve (12) months unless the y opt - out during their initial 45 - day period . Bill  stabilization ensures that during the i niti al 12 - months under PDP, the customer  will not pay more t h an it would have had it opted - out to the applicable TOU rate.  If a customer terminates its participation   on the PDP rate prior to the ini tial  12 - mon th period expiring, the customer will receive b ill   stabi lization up to the  date when the customer terminate s   its participation. Bill stabilization benefits  will be computed on a cumulative basis, based on the ea rlier of 1) when a  customer termi nates its p articipation on the PDP rate or 2) at the end o f th e  ini tial 12 - month period. Any applicable credits will   b e applied to the customer’s  account on a subsequent regular bill. Bill stabilization is only available   one time  per customer. If a cust omer un - enr olls or terminates its participation on a PDP  r ate,   bill   stabilization will not be offered again.  Active   5   t o 8   PDP customers who have not completed 12 - months of   bill  stabilization   by the time they are transitio ned to   4 to 9   PDP in their March 202 2  billing c ycle will seamlessly continue with their   bill s tabi lizat ion   under   4 to 9   PDP  until 12 - months have elapse d   since their initial enrollment in   5 to 8   PDP, or until  they optionally unenroll from   4 to 9   PDP before 12 - months .

Bill Stabilization   ( Cont ’ d) :   5 to 8   PDP customers who have   already re ceived  12 - months of   bill stabilization , will no t re ceive   bill stabilization   for a second time  when they are transitioned to   4 to 9   PDP.  c.   Notificati on E quipment :   At the customer’s option and expense, it is  recommended, but not required that a customer provide a phone number or an  e - mail address to receive automated   voice, text, or email   notification messa ges  of a PDP event fro m PG&E.  If a PDP event   occ urs, customers will be notified u sing one or more of the  above - mentioned systems. Receipt of such notice is the responsibility of the  participating customer. PG&E will make reasonable efforts to notify cu stomers,  however it is   the customer’s responsi bili ty to receive such notice and to   check  the PG&E website to see if a PDP event has been activated. It is also the  customer’s responsibility to maintain accurate notification contact information.  PG&E does   not guarantee the reli ability of the phone, e - mail   system, or Internet  site by whic h the customer receives notification.  PG&E may conduct notification test events once a month to ensure a  customer’s contact information is up - to - date. These are not actual   PDP events  and no load   reduction is required. \\  d.   PG& E Website : The customer’s actual   energy usage is available at PG&E’s  “Your Account” website. This data may not match billing quality data, and the  customer understands and agrees that the data posted to P G&E’s “Your  Account” w ebsite may be different   from   the actual bill.  e.   Program Operati ons : A maximum of fifteen (15) PDP events and a minimum  of nine (9) PDP events may be called in any calendar year. PG&E will notify  customers by   4:00 p.m . on   a day - ahead b asis when a PDP event   will occur the  next day.   Th e PDP program will operate year - r ound and PDP events may be  called for any day of the week.  PG&E may conduct outreach/notification by any available channel (direct mail,  phone call,   email and/or text) for P DP customers.  f.   Event Cancellation o r Reduction :   PG &E may initiate the cancellation of a  PDP eve nt before   5 :00 p.m. the day - ahead of a noticed PDP event. If PG&E  cancels an event, it will count the cancelled event toward the PDP limits. PG&E  may also canc el   events b y   5 :00 p.m.   on a day - ahead basis or   on   the Event Day  itself i n response to an emergency situation, such as a proclamation of a state  of emergency and/or disaster by a local, state and/or federal government.

Kenney   Effective   June 1, 2022  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  PEAK DAY  PRICING  DETAILS  (Cont ’d.).  g.   Program Options : Customers may customize their PDP participation   by  choosing either a) no limit on the number of consecutive PDP events or b) every  other PDP event. Customers electing every other PDP event will be divi ded  into two groups and only be subject to a maximum of one - half of the PDP  events called and the corr esponding PDP rate credits will be reduced by 50%.  Customers that do not elect an option will be defaulted to the no limit on the  number of consecutive P DP events. The duration of PDP Event Operations for  both options will be from   4 :00 p.m. to   9 :00 p.m.   ( five - hour window).  h.   Event Trigger : PG&E will trigger a PDP event when the day - ahead  temperature forecast trigger is reached. The trigger will be the av e rage of the  day - ahead maximum temperature forecasts for San Jose, Concord, Red Bluff,  Sacramento and   Fresno.  Beginning June 1 of each summer season, the PDP events on non - holiday  weekdays will be triggered at 98 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and will be trigge r ed  at 105°F on holidays and weekends. If needed, PG&E will adjust the non -  holiday weekday trigger up   or down over the course of the summer to achieve  the range of 9 to 15 PDP events in any calendar year. Such adjustments would  be made no more than twice   per month and would be posted on PG&E’s PDP  Website.  PDP events may also be initiated as warranted on a day - ahead basis by 1)  extreme system conditions such as special alerts issued by the California  Independent System Operator, 2) under conditions of hig h   forecasted California  spot market power prices, 3) t o meet annual PDP event limits for a calendar  year, or 4) for testing/evaluation purposes.  i.   Program Terms : A customer may opt - out anytime during its initial 12 months  on a PDP rate. After the initial   12 months, customer’s participation will be in  accord ance with Electric Rule 12.  Customers may opt - out of a PDP rate at anytime to enroll in another demand  response program beginning May 1, 2011.  j.   Interaction with Other PG&E Demand Response Programs : Pu r suant to  D.18 - 11 - 029, customers on a PDP rate may no   longer participate in another  demand response program offered by PG&E or a third - party demand response  provider as of October 26, 2018. If dual enrolled in BIP and PDP prior to  October 26, 2018 then pa r ticipation will be capped at the customer’s subscribe d  megawatt level as of December 10, 2018. New dual enrollment in BIP and  PDP as of October 26, 2018 is no longer available. If a NEM customer is on  PDP, the customer cannot participate in a third - party   Demand Response  program unless it ceases to be a PDP   customer. If a third - party signs a NEM  customer up under Rule 24 at the CAISO, the customer is automatically  removed from PDP.

Kenney   Effective   July 8, 2021  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  1. APPLICABILITY :   Initial Assignment:   A customer must take service under Schedule   B - 19 if:   (1)   the  customer's load does not meet the Schedule B - 20 requirements, but, (2)   the  customer's maximum billing demand (as defined below) has exceeded  499   kilowatts for at least three   consecutive months during the most recent  12 - month period (referred to as Schedule   B - 19).   If 70   percent or more of the  customer's energy use is for agricultural end - uses, the customer will be served  under an agricultural schedule.   Schedule   B - 19 is not applicable to customers for  whom residential service would apply, except for single - phase and polyphase  service in common areas in a multifamily complex (see Common - Area Accounts  section).  Decision 18 - 08 - 013 adopted new TOU periods for all non - residential customer  classes.   Schedules A - 1, A - 6, A - 10, E - 19 and E - 20 will be retained as legacy rate  schedules with their   legacy   TOU periods until the rates with new TOU periods  (Schedules B - 1, B - 6, B - 10, B - 19 and B - 20) established in the same proceeding,  become mandatory in   March 2021 .   Certain qualifying customers with solar  systems will be permitted to maintain their existing   legacy   TOU periods for a  certain period of time, per Decision 17 - 01 - 006, as described in the Electric Rule 1*,  Definitions: Behind - the - Meter Solar   Legacy   TOU   Period   Eligibility Requirements.  These new rates with revised TOU periods adopted in D.18 - 08 - 013   were   available  to qualifying customers on a voluntary opt - in basis   from   November 2019   through  February 2021.  Customers eligible for this rate schedule must have an interval data meter that can  be read remotely by PG&E.   Beginning on   March 2021 , customers still served on  Schedule E - 19, with the exception of solar   legacy   TOU period   customers  referenced above, will be transitioned to Schedule B - 19.   The transition notification  and default process are further described in the legacy rate Schedule E - 19.  Customer accounts which fail to qualify under these requirements will be evaluated  for transfer to service under a different applicable rate schedule.  The provisions of Schedule SB — Standby Service Special Conditions 1 through 6  shall also apply to customers served under this schedule whose premises are  regularly supplied in part (but   not   in whole) by electric energy from a nonutility  source of supply.   These customers will pay monthly reservation charges as  specified under Section 1 of Schedule SB, in addition to all applicable Schedule B -  19 charges.   Exemptions to standby charges are outlined in the Standby  Applicability Section of this rate schedule.  Eligibility for Schedule B - 19:   This schedule is available on a voluntary basis for  customers with maximum billing demands less than 500 kW. Customers  voluntarily taking service on this schedule are subject to all the terms and  conditions below, unless otherwise specified in Section 1 3 .   If a customer’s  maximum demand has failed to exceed 499 kilowatts for 12 consecutive months,  PG&E will transfer that customer’s account to voluntary B - 19 service or to a  different applicable rate schedule.  (T)  (T)  (T)  (T)  *   The rules referred to in this schedule are part of PG&E’s electric tariffs.

APPLICABILITY:  (Cont’d.)  Assignment of New Customers:   If a customer is new and PG&E believes that  the customer’s maximum demand will be 500 through 999 kilowatts and that the  customer should not be served under a time o f use agricul tural schedule, PG&E  wi ll serve the customer’s account under   Mandatory   Schedule B - 19 .  Definition of Maximum Demand:   Demand will be averaged over 15 - minute  intervals for customers whose maximum demand exceeds 499   kW. “Maximum  demand” will be the highest of all the 15 - minute ave rages for the billing month. If  the c ustomer’s use of electricity is intermittent or subject to severe fluctuations, a  5 - minute interval may be used. If the customer has any welding machines, the  diversified resistance welder load, calculated in accordan ce with Section J of  Rule   2, will be c onsidered the maximum demand if it exceeds the maximum  demand that results from averaging the demand over 15 - minute intervals. The  customer’s maximum - peak - period demand will be the highest of all the 15 - minute  average s for the peak period during the billi ng month. (See Section   6 for a  definition of “Peak - Period.”) See Section   13 for the definition of maximum demand  for customers voluntarily selecting B - 19.  Option R for   Standalone   Storage :   The Option R rate is avail ab le to quali fying  customers taking Bundled, Direct   Access (DA) or Community Choice Aggregation  (CCA) service under Schedule B - 19, or voluntary B - 19. Eligible customers  system must have a minimum discharge capacity equal to or greater than 20  percent o f   the customer’s annual peak demand, as recorded over the previous 12  months to be eligible for Option R. Discharge capacity for Option R will be  calculated using the same m ethod as that used for Option S .   For additional O ption  R details and program specif ic s,   see   Sections 3 and 1 8 .  Option R for Renewable Distributed Generation Technologies : The   Option R  rate is available to qualifying customers taking Bundled, DA or CCA service under  Schedule B - 19, or voluntary B - 19. Eligible customers system with solar, w in d, fuel  cells or other eligible onsite renewable distributed generation technologies as  d efined by the California Solar Initiative program (CSI) or Self Generation Incentive  Program (SGIP), customers with behind - the - meter storage paired with such  renewab le   distributed generation, and Permanent Load Shifting (PLS)  technologies. Eligible renewab le generation systems and PLS systems must have  a net renewable generating capacity or load shift capacity equal to or greater than  15 percent of the customer’s annu al   peak demand, as recorded over the previous  12 months. For additional Option R details an d program specifics, including the  participation cap, see Sections 3 and 18.  Option S for Storage:   The Option S rate for storage is available   to qualifying  customers   t aking Bundled, DA or CCA service under Schedule B - 19 or voluntary  B - 19. Eligible customers must have storage systems with rated capacity in watts  which is at least 10% of the customer’s peak demand over the previous 12  months. O ption S is available sub je ct to an enrollment cap. For additional Option  S details and program specifics see Sections 3 and 20.  S tandby Demand:   For customers served u nder this rate schedule and for whom  Schedule SB — St andby Service Special Conditions   1 through 6 apply, standby  d em and is the portion of a customer’s maximum demand in any month caused by  nonoperation of the customer’s   alternate source of power, and for whi ch a demand  charge is paid under the regular servic e schedule.

APPLICABILITY:  (Cont’d.)  If the customer imposes standby demand in any month, then the regular service  maximum demand charge will be reduced by the applicable reservation capacity  charge (see Schedule   SB Special Condit ion   1).  To qualify for the above reduc tion in the m aximum demand charge, the customer  must, within 30 days of the regular meter - read date, demonstrate to the satisfaction  of PG&E the amount of standby demand in any mon th. This may be done by  submitting to   PG&E a completed Electric Standby Ser vice Log Shee t (Form 79 - 726).  Peak Day Pricing Default Rates:   Peak Day Pricing (PDP) rates provide customers  the opportunity to manage their electric costs by reducing load during high cost  periods or shifting load from high cost periods to lower cost per iods.   Decision 10 -  02 - 032 ordered that beginning May 1, 2010, e ligible large Commercial and Industrial  (C&I) customers default to PDP rates. A customer is eligible for default when 1) it  has at least twelve (12) months of hourly usage data available, and   2) it   has  measured demands equal to or exceeding 200 kW for thr ee (3) consecutive months  during the past 12 months. All eligible customers will be placed on PDP rate s  unless they opt - out to a TOU rate.  Decision10 - 02 - 032, as modified by Decision 11 - 11 - 008,   orde r ed that beginning  November 1, 2014, eligible small and med ium C&I customers (those with demands  that are not equal to or greater than 200 kW for three consecutive months) default to  PDP rates. A customer is eligible for default when it has at least   twelv e   (12) billing  months of hourly usage data available and tw o years of experience on TOU rates.  All eligible customers will be placed on PDP rates unless they opt - out to a TOU rate.  Customers with a SmartMeter TM   system, or interval meter, installed t hat c a n be  remotely read by PG&E may also voluntarily elect to e nroll on PDP rates.  Bundled service customers are eligible for PDP. Direct Access (DA) and  Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) service customers are not eligible, including  those DA cust omers   on tr ansitional bundled service (TBS). Customers on standby  service (Schedule SB) whose premises are regularly supplied in full by electric  energy from a nonutility source of supply, net - energy metering Schedules NEMFC,  NEMBIO, NEMCCSF, or NEMA, or   an ene rgy p ayment demand response program  are not eligible for PDP. Customers that take standby service whose premises   are  regularly supplied in part (but not in full) by electric energy from a nonutility source of  supply are eligible for PDP on the non - standb y por tion of their service. In addition,  master - metered customers are not eligible, except for commercial buildings with  submetering as stated in PG&E Rule 1 and Rule 18.

Rates:  (Cont’d.)  a.   TYPES OF CHARGES: The customer’s monthly charge for service under  Schedule   B - 19 is the sum of a customer charge, demand charges, and energy  charges:  −   The   customer charge   is a flat monthly fee.  −   This schedule   has three   demand charges,   a maximum - peak - period - demand  charge, a maximum part - peak - period and a maximum - demand charge. The  maximum - peak - period - demand charge per kilowatt applies to the maximum  demand during the month’s peak hours, the maximum part - peak - period demand  charge per kil owatt applies to the maximum demand during the month’s part - peak  hours, and the maximum demand charge per kilowatt applies to the maximum  demand at any time during the month. The bill will include   all   of these demand  charges. Option S includes variations   of these basic demand charge types  assessed on a (1) daily basis by time period and (2) maximum monthly basis  applied to all hours except 9 am to 2 pm. (Time periods are defined in Section   6.)  −   The   energy charge   is the sum of the energy charges from the p eak, partial - peak,  and off - peak periods. The customer pays for energy by the kilowatt - hour (kWh),  and rates are differentiated according to time of day and time of year.  −   The monthly charges may be increased or decreased based upon the power  factor. (See   Section 7.)  −   As shown on the rate chart, which set of customer, demand, and energy charges is  paid depends on the level of the customers maximum demand and the voltage at  which service is taken. Service voltages are defined in Section   5 below.  ( L )  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  4.   METERING  REQUIRE -  MENTS:  An interval data meter that measures and registers the amount of electricity a customer  uses and can be read remotely by PG&E is required for all customers on this schedule.

DEFINITION  OF SERVICE  VOLTAGE:  The following defines the three   voltage classes of Schedule   B - 19   rates. Standard Service  Voltages are listed in Rule   2, Section B.1.  a.   Secondary : This is the voltage class if the service voltage is less than 2,400   volts   or if  the definitions of “primary” and “transmission” do not apply to the service.  b.   Primary : This is the voltage class if the customer is served from a “single customer  substation” or   without transformation   from PG&E’s serving distribution system at on e  of the standard primary voltages specified in PG&E’s   Electric Rule   2, Section B.1.  c.   Transmission: This is the voltage class if the customer is served   without  transformation   from PG&E’s serving transmission system at one of the standard  transmission vo ltages specified in PG&E’s Rule   2, Section   B.1.  ( L )  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  6.   DEFINITION  OF TIME  PERIODS:  Times of the year and times of the day are defined as follows:  SUMMER (Service from June   1 through September   30):  Peak :   4:00 p.m.   to   9 :00 p.m.   Every day, including weekends  and holidays  Partial - peak:   2:00   p .m. to   4 :00   pm   AND  9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  Every day, including weekends  and holidays  Off - peak :   All other Hours .

POWER  FACTOR  ADJUST -  MENTS:  Bills will be adjusted based on the power factor for all customers except those selecting  voluntary B - 19 service. The power factor is computed from a trigonometric function of the  ratio of lagging reactive kilovolt - ampere - hou rs to the kilowatt - hours consumed in the month.  Power factors are rounded to the nearest whole percent.  The rates in this rate schedule are based on a power factor of 85   percent. If the average  power factor is greater than 85   percent, the total monthly b ill will be reduced by the product  of the power factor rate and the kilowatt - hour usage for each percentage point above  85   percent. If the average power factor is below 85   percent, the total monthly bill will be  increased by the product of the power facto r rate and the kilowatt - hour usage for each  percentage point below 85   percent.  Power factor adjustments will be assigned to distribution for billing purposes.  ( L )  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  8.   CHARGES  FOR TRANS -  FORMER AND  LINE LOSSES:  The demand and energy   meter readings used in determining the charges will be adjusted to  correct for transformation and line losses in accordance with Section   B.4 of Rule   2.  |  |  |  |  |  9.   STANDARD  SERVICE  FACILITIES:  If PG&E must install any new or additional facilities to pro vide the customer with service  under this schedule   the customer may have to pay some of the cost. Any advance  necessary and any monthly charge for the facilities will be specified in a line extension  agreement. See Rules   2, 15, and 16 for details. This   section does not apply to customers  voluntarily taking service under Schedule   B - 19.  Facilities installed to serve the customer may be removed when service is discontinued.  The customer will then have to repay PG&E for all or some of its investment in the   facilities.  Terms and conditions for repayment will be set forth in the line extension agreement.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  10.   SPECIAL  FACILITIES:  PG&E will normally install only those standard facilities it deems necessary to provide  service under this sched ule.   If the customer requests any additional facilities, those  facilities will be treated as “special facilities” in accordance with   Section   I of Rule   2.  |  |  |  ( L )\n\nU 39   San Francisco, California  Revised   Cal.

COMMON -  AREA  ACCOUNTS:  Common - area accounts are those accounts that provide electric service to Common Use  Areas as defined in Rule 1. Common - area accounts that are separately metered by PG&E  and which took electric service from PG&E on or prior to J anuary 16, 2003, ha d   a one - time  opportunity to return to a residential rate schedule from April 1, 2004 to May 31, 2004, by  notifying PG&E in writing. These accounts remain eligible for service under this rate  schedule if the customer did not invoke this   first right of return.  In the event that the CPUC substantially amends any or all of PG&E’s commercial or  residential rate schedules, the Executive Council of Homeowners (ECHO) can direct PG&E  to begin an optional second right - of - return period lasting 105   days.  Newly constructed common - areas that are separately metered by PG&E and which first  took electric service from PG&E after January 16, 2003, have a one - time opportunity to  transfer to a residential rate schedule during a two - month window that begins   14   months  after taking service on a commercial rate schedule. This must be done by notifying PG&E  in writing. These common - area accounts have an additional opportunity to return to a  residential schedule in the event that ECHO directs PG&E to begin a se c ond right - of - return  period.

Option R   The Option R rate is available to qualifying customers with   eligible technologies as described  in the applicability section of this tariff. Across all applicable rate schedules, Option R  participation is capped at 600 MW of generating or stor age discharge capacity. Eligible  Permanent Load   Shift (PLS) technologies are not subject to this cap.  For eligible stand - alone storage, the qualifying capacity counted towards the Option  R cap is the discharge capacity of the storage system or systems, ca lculating using  the same method as is used for Op tion S.  For eligible renewable technologies, the qualifying capacity counted towards the  Option R participation cap is based on net renewable generating capacity (i.e., the  amount of power actually delivered   by the generator or generators net of any losses  such as   auxiliary loads, thermal management loads, etc.).  For paired storage systems, the qualifying capacity counted towards the Option R  cap is the larger of the system’s California Energy Commission (CEC ) alternating  current (AC) solar capacity or the discharg e capacity of the storage system  calculated using the same method as that used for Option S (but not both). No  Benefitting* or Aggregated* account is eligible for Option R unless there is an  eligible   technology interconnected at that account that independe ntly meets the  Option R minimum size requirements relative to peak load, as described in the  applicability section of this tariff.

OPTIMAL  BILLING  PERIOD  SERVICE:  The Optimal Billing Period (OBP) service is a voluntary program available to bundled, direct  access and community choice aggregation customers taking service on Schedule B - 19 or  Schedule   B - 20. To qualify, a meter must ha ve registered a demand of 500 kW or greater at  least once during the most recent 12 months. The OBP service is limited to 50 service  accounts with interval billed meters.  Customers electing this service must complete the “Optimal Billing Period Service Ele ction  Form” (Form 79 - 1111).  Decision 18 - 08 - 013 expanded the eligibility of OBP to Schedule B - 19 (above 500 kW as  defined above), Schedule   B - 20, and to direct access and community choice aggregation  customers taking service on eligible schedules. Decision   18 - 08 - 013 retained the  participation cap of 50 positions, and reserved 36 positions for agricultural accounts, and 14  positions for commercial and industrial accounts. Before declining participation of any  otherwise eligible account based on these particip ation limits, PG&E will verify that all other  enrolled accounts are still eligible for the program.  Customers on net energy metering Schedules VNEM, NEMBIO, NEMFC, NEMCCSF,  NEMA or RES - BCT are not eligible for OBP service.  The OBP service allows a billin g cycle(s) to coincide with the customer’s high seasonal  production cycle. The customer designates the OBP by selecting one or both of the  following:  a) a specific month and day for the start of the OBP; and/or  b) a specific month and day for the end of   the OBP.  PG&E will use the customer’s usage from the preceding twelve (12) billing months to  determine eligibility for the OBP service. To qualify, the average of the previous high  season monthly maximum demand must be at least double the average of the   low season  monthly maximum demand. The customer must also specify which six consecutive months  will be their high season optimal billing period.  The start and end dates must fall within the customer’s high seasonal production cycle. In  no event shall any   revised billing period exceed forty - five (45) days or be less than fifteen  (15) days. To qualify for this option, the customer must designate an OBP of not more than  six (6) months in duration.  To designate the specific date for the start or end of the OB P, a participating customer must  email PG&E at least seventy - two (72) hours in advance and such email shall state in its  subject line “OBP Notification.” The designation may not be implemented if it is not  received or if it does not contain the specified   information.

OPTIMAL  BILLING  PERIOD  SERVICE:  (Cont’d.)  Prior to receiving OBP service, the customer must pay an annual OBP fee of $160.00 per  meter. In order to retain the OBP service option in each subsequent year, the annual  participation fee must be received by   PG&E by the anniversary date of the contract. PG&E  will bill the annual OBP fee upon the anniversary date of the contract unless the customer  terminates the contract. For billing purposes, the annual participation fee shall be assigned  to Distribution.  A. No Retroactive Application  No customer shall be entitled to a refund associated with the OBP service for costs that  might have been avoided had the service been available at an earlier point in time.  B. Customer Notification to PG&E  A customer must hav e at least 12 months of usage on a specific meter before the OBP  service can be received on that particular meter.

OPTION S   The Option S rate for storage is available to qualifying customers taking Bundled, DA or  CCA service under Schedule B - 19 or voluntary B - 19.   Eligible customers must have storage  systems with rated capacity in watts which is at least 10% of   t he   customer’s peak demand  over the previous 12 months.   Customers do not need to participate in the Self Generation  Incentive Program to participate in this program.  The cap for Option S enrollment will be considered reached when the MW value hits 50 MW  p er rate schedule, separately for   B - 19V,   B - 19 and B - 20 .  For purposes of determining eligibility for Option S, the usage of the customer over the  previous 12 months will be determined by the max demand.   Stor age   rated capacity will be  determined by PTO agree ment.  When a customer first moves to a location with installed storage, the minimum 30 days of  usage history required to evaluate whether the battery capacity is at least 10% of the  customer’s peak demand   w ill not yet   be available. Thus, qualifying custom ers starting a  B19 Service Agreement at a new location will not be on Option S on day 1 of their new SA  activation.  The rated capacity (W) for energy storage technologies is calculated as follows:  •   DC/AC sy stems: The   nominal voltage multiplied by the amp - h our capacity  multiplied by the applicable efficiency divided by the duration of discharge ((VDC x  Amp - Hours x (1 kW/1000W) x Applicable Efficiency) / Duration of Discharge).  o   The following specifications mus t be provi ded to calculate rated capacity:  ▪   Duratio n of discharge (hours)  ▪   DC dischargeable amp - hour capacity, associated with the  duration of discharge specified, including all losses and ancillary  loads (such as power conditioning and thermal management)  ▪   N ominal vol tage (VDC)  ▪   Applicable efficiency (if nec essary), which accounts for  conversion, transformation, or other efficiency losses (e.g.  Inverter CEC weighted efficiency, DC - DC converter efficiency,  etc.) systems, this is rated in DC, and for AC systems,   this is  r ated in AC.  ▪   The continuous maximum power   output capability of the system.  For DC systems, this is rated in DC, and for AC systems, this is  rated in AC.  The following are not eligible for Option S:  o   100% Standby customers  o   SAs enrolled in Option R a re not eli gible for Option S and vice versa  o   SAs on   Virtual NEM, NEM Aggregation, NEMBIO, NEMFC, RES - BCT  o   Customers with EMR meters  Note: PG&E expects to be able to allow customers to take service on Schedule E -  BIP with Option S by   March   31 ,   2020.

In   March 202 2 ,   customers wh o   are   enrolled in the   version of PDP   with   5 :00 p.m.   –  8 :00   p.m. PDP Event Hours   (5   to   8 PDP)   will be   transitioned   to a   new version of PDP  with   4 :00 p.m.   –   9 :00 p.m. PDP Event Hours   (4 to 9 PDP) .  Starting in March 202 2 ,   5   to   8   PDP   will be discontinued, and   4 to 9   PDP will   b e a vail a ble  only on the new rates with later TOU hours .  Pursuant to a modification granted by the CPUC Executive Director by letter dated   June  14, 2021, PG&E was allowed an extension to March 2022 to default eligible  non - residential and no n - agricultural c u stomers   to PDP rate plans as required by  Ordering Paragraph 1 of D.10 - 02 - 032 and Ordering Paragraph 1(d) of D.11 - 11 - 008.  Bundled service Net Energy Metering (NEM) custo mers   taking service on Schedule  NEM, NEMV, NEMVMASH, NEM2, NEM2V, or NE M2VMSH are eligi b le for   default to  PDP and   to   opt - in to PDP. NEM customers on NEMBIO, NEM FC, NEMCCSF, and  NEMA are not eligible f or PD P. The NEM Annual True - Up billing date, and the f irst   year  PDP Bill Stabilization date in section b below, may be indepe ndent 12 - month p e riods.  After the first year on PDP, NEM credits can offset PDP charges.   PDP credits and  charges will be provide d for   exported generation. All PDP billing for NEM cust omers   will  be based on net usage during each 15 - minute interval.  b.   Capaci ty Reservation L e vel : Cu stomers may elect a capacity reservation level  (CRL) and pay for a   fixed level of capacity, specified in k W. Wh ile the CRL is  applicable year round, customers el ectin g a CRL will be billed on a take - or - pay  basis up to the specified   CRL under the no n - PDP ra te of this schedule during the  summer period (June 1 through Septe mber 30). This means that customers will   be  b illed for summer peak generation demand charges up   to t he level of their CRL,  even in summer months when the actual deman d might be less   t han the ir CRL.  Customers will receive PDP credits on summer usage above t he CRL on all  summer - period days. All us age d uring a PDP event protected under the CRL will be  bille d at the non - PDP rate. All usage above the CRL (as measured in 15 - minute  intervals ) , and n ot protected during a PDP event, will be billed at the PDP rate. I f a  customer fails to elect an initial C RL, t he customer’s initial CRL will be set at 50% of  it s mos t recent   full   summer   season   average peak - period maximum demand and  may go back to   t he prev ious year to make a full summer season (if available). If the  customer has not established any histori c sum mer billing demand, the CRL will be  set at zero (0 ). T h e CRL for all customers, including NEM customers, must be  greater than   or equal to zer o   (0). A   customer may only elect to change their CRL  once every 12 - mon ths.

PEAK DAY  PRICING  DETAILS  (Cont ’ d.):  c.   Bill Stabilization :   PDP customers will be offered bill stabilization for the initial  twelve (12) months unless they opt - out during their initial 45 - day period. Bill  stabilization ensures that during the initial 12 - months   under PDP, the customer  will not pay more than it would have had it opted - out to the applicable TOU  rate.  If a customer terminates its participation on the PDP rate prior to the initial 12 -  month period expiring, the customer will receive bill stabil ization   up to the date  when the customer terminates its participation. Bill stabilization benefits will be  computed on a cumulative basis, based on the earlier of 1) when a customer  terminates its participation on the PDP rate or 2) at the end of the init ial 12 -  month period. Any applicable credits will be applied to the customer’s account  on a subsequent regular bill. Bill stabilization is only available one time per  customer. If a customer un - enrolls or terminates its participation on a PDP  rate, bill   stabili zation will not be offered again.  Active   5   to 8   PDP customers who have not completed 12 - months of bill  stabilization   by the time they are transitioned to   4 to 9   PDP   in their March 202 2  billing cycle will seamlessly continue with their bill stabiliza ti on   under   4 to 9  PDP until 12 - months have elapsed since their initial enrollment in   5 to 8   PDP,  or until they optionally unenroll from   4 to 9   PDP before 12 - months.  5   to   8   PDP   customers who have already received 12 - months of bill  stabilization , will not   receiv e bill stabilization   for a second time when they are  transitioned to   4 to 9   PDP.  d.   Notification Equipment :   At the customer’s option and expense, it is  recommended, but   not required that a customer provide a phone number or an  e - mail address to   r ecei ve a utomated   voice , text, or email   notification messages  of a PDP event from PG&E.  If a PDP event occurs, customers will be notified using one or more of the  above - mentioned systems. Receipt of   such notice is the responsibility of the  participating   cust omer . PG&E will make reas onable efforts to notify customers,  however it is the customer’s responsibility to receive such notice and to check  the PG&E website to see if a PDP event has been activa ted. It is also the  customer’s responsibility to maint a in a ccur ate notification conta ct information.  PG&E does not guarantee the reliability of the phone, e - mail system, or Internet  site by which the customer receives notification.  PG&E may conduct notif ication test events once a month to ensure a  customer’s   cont act   information is up - to - d ate. These are not actual PDP events  and no load reduction is required.  e.   PG&E Website : The customer’s actual energy usage is available at PG&E’s  “Your Account” website.   This data may not match billing quality data, and the  c usto mer   understands and agrees   that the data posted to PG&E’s “Your  Account” website may be different from the actual bill.

PEAK DAY  PRICING  DETAILS  (Cont ’d.):  f.   Program Operations : A maximum of fifteen (15) PDP events and a minimum  of nine (9) PDP events may be called in any calendar year. PG&E will notify  customers by   4 :00 p.m. on a day - ahead basis when a PDP event will o ccur the  next day. The PDP program   will operate year - round and PDP events may be  called for any day of the week.  PG&E may conduct outreach/notification by any available channel (direct mail ,  phone call, email and/or text) for PDP customers.  g.   E vent Cancell ation or Reduction : PG&E may initiate the cancellation of a  PDP event before   5 :00 p.m. the day - ahead of a noticed PDP event. If   PG&E  cancels an event, it will count   the cancelled event toward the PDP l imits.  PG&E may also cancel   PDP e vents by   5 :00 p.m.   on a day - ahead basis or   on  the Event Day itself in response to an emergency situation, such as a  proclamation   of a state of emergency and/or disaste r by a local, state and/or  federal g overnment.  h.   Event Trigger : PG&E will t rigger a PDP   event when the day - ahead  temperature forecast trigger is reached. The trigger will be the average of the  day - ahead maximum tempe rature forecasts for San Jose, Conc ord, Red Bluff,  Sacramento and Fresno.  Beginning June 1 of each summer season,   the PDP event s on non - holiday  we ekdays will be triggered at 98 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and will be triggered  at 105°F on holidays and weekend s. If needed, PG&E will adjust the   non -  holiday weekday trigger up or down   over the course of the summer to achiev e  the range o f 9 to 15 PDP event s in any calendar year. Such adjustments would  be made no more than twice per month and would be posted on PG &E’s PDP  Website.  PDP events may al so be initiated as warranted on a day - a head basis by 1)  extreme system conditio ns such as sp ecial alerts issued   by the California  Independent System Operator, 2) under conditions of high forecasted California  spot market   power prices, 3) to meet annual PDP   event limits for a calendar  year, or 4 ) for testing/evaluation purposes.  i.   Pro gram Terms:   A customer may opt - out anytime during its initial 12 - months  on a PDP rate. After the initial 12 - months, customer’s participation   will be in  accordance with Elec tric Rule 12.  Customers may opt - out of a   PDP rate at anytime to enroll in another   demand  respo nse program beginni ng May 1, 2011.  j.   Interaction with Other PG&E Demand Response Programs :   Pursuant to  D.18 - 11 - 029, customers on   a PDP rate may no longer participate in another  demand response program o ffered by PG&E or a third - party demand r esponse  provi der as of October 2 6, 2018. If dual enrolled in BIP and PDP prior to  October 26, 2018 then   participation will be capped at the c ustomer’s subscribed  megawatt level as of December 10, 2018. New dual enr ollment in BIP and  PDP as of October 26,   2018 is no l onger available. If   a NEM customer is on  PDP, the customer cannot participate in a third - par ty Demand Response  program unless it   ceases to be a PDP customer. If a third - party signs a NEM  customer up und er Rule 24 at the CAISO, the customer is   automaticall y  removed from PDP.

APPLICABILITY:   Initial Assignment:   A customer is eligible for service under Schedule   B - 20 if the  customer’s maximum demand (as defined below) has exceeded 999   kilowatts for at least  three   consecutive months during the most recent 12 - month period. If 70   p ercent or more of  the customer’s energy use is for agricultural end - uses, the customer will be served under an  agricultural schedule.  Customer accounts which fail to qualify under these requirements will be evaluated for  transfer to service under a differe nt applicable rate schedule.  Decision 18 - 08 - 013 adopted new TOU periods for all non - residential customer classes.  Schedules A - 1, A - 6, A - 10, E - 19 and E - 20 will be retained as legacy rate schedules with  their   legacy   TOU periods until the rates with new TOU   periods   (Schedules B - 1, B - 6, B - 10,  B - 19 and B - 20) established in the same proceeding, become mandatory in   March 2021 .  Certain qualifying customers with solar systems will be permitted to maintain   their existing  legacy   TOU   peri ods for a certain perio d of t ime, pe r Decision 17 - 01 - 006, as described in the  Electric Rule 1, Definitions: Behind - the - Meter Solar   Legacy   TOU   Period   Eligibility  Requirements.  These new rates with revised TOU periods   were   available to qualifying customers on a  voluntary opt - in bas is   f rom   No vember   2019   through February 2021 .  Customers eligible for this rate schedule must have an inte rval data meter that can be read  remotely by PG&E. Beginning on   March 2021 , customers still s erved o n Schedule E - 20,  with the exception of sol ar   l egacy   T O U peri od   cu stomers referenced above, will be  transitioned to Schedule B - 20. The transition notification an d default process are further  described in the legacy rate Schedule E - 20.  The provisions of S chedule   S B — Standby Service Special Conditions 1 through   6   sh all   also  apply to customers served under this schedule whose premises are regularly supplied in  part (b ut   not   in whole) by electric energy from a nonutility source of supply. These  customers will   pay mo nthly reservation charges as specified under Sect i on   1 o f Sch edule S,  in addition to all applicable Schedule B - 20 charges. Exemptions to standby charges ar e  outlined in the Standby Applicability Section of this rate schedule.  Transfers Off of Sched ule B - 2 0:   PG&E will review its Schedule   B - 20 accounts a n nua lly .  A   customer will be eligible for continued service on Schedule   B - 20 if its maximum demand  has eith er: (1)   Exceeded 999   kilowatts for at least 5 of the previous 12   billing months; or  (2)   Exce eded 99 9   kilowatts for any 3 consecutive billing months   o f t he   previ ous 14   billing  months. If a customer’s demand history fails both of these tests, PG&E will tra nsfer that  customer’s account to service under a different applicable rate schedule.

APPLICABILITY:  (Cont’d.)  Definition of Maximum Demand:   Demand will be averaged over 15 - minute intervals.  “Maximum demand” will be the highest of all the 15 - minute averages for the billing month. If  the customer’s use of electricity is intermittent   or subject to severe fluctuations, a 5 - minute  interval may be used. If the customer has any welding machines, the diversified resistance  welder load, calculated in accordance with Section   J of Rule   2, will be considered the  maximum demand if it exceeds th e maximum demand that results from averaging the  demand over 15 - minute intervals. The customer’s maximum - peak - period demand will be  the highest of all the 15 - minute averages for the peak period during the billing month. (See  Section   6 for a definition of   “Peak - Period.”)  Standby Demand:   For customers under this rate schedule and for whom Schedule SB —  Standby Service Special Conditions 1 through 6 apply, standby demand is the portion of a  customer’s maximum demand in any month caused by nonoperation of the   customer’s  alternate source of power, and for which a demand charge is paid under the regular service  schedule.  If the customer imposes standby demand in any month, then the regular service maximum  demand charge will be reduced by the applicable reservati on capacity charge (see  Schedule   SB Special Condition   1).  To qualify for the above reduction in the maximum demand charge, the customer must,  within 30 days of the regular meter read date, demonstrate to the satisfaction of PG&E the  amount of standby deman d in any month. This may be done by submitting to PG&E a  completed Electric Standby Service Long Sheet (Form 79 - 726).  Option R for   Standalone   S torage :   The Option R rate is available to qualifying Bundled,  DA and CCA B - 20 customers .   Eligible customers sys te m must have a minimum discharge  capacity equal to or greater than 20 percent of the customer’s annual peak demand, as  recorded over the previous 12 months to be eligible for Option R. Discharge capacity for  Option R will be calculat ed using the same meth od   as that used for Option S.

APPLICABILITY:  (Cont’d.)  Fuel Cell Generation Demand Adjustment:   A customer who installs a fuel cell electric  generation facility ma y be eligible to receive a Generation Demand Adjustment. A customer  will qualify for a Generation Demand Adjustment if b oth of the following conditions are met:  (1) the customer’s fuel cell electric generation facility was installed (and approved for  int erconnection by PG&E); and (2) the electric generation facility reduces the customer’s  maximum demand to the point that t he customer would no longer be eligible for service under  this schedule. The Generation Demand Adjustment will be the fixed reduction   in demand as  determined by PG&E from the customer’s interconnection agreement, and will be added to  the customer’s maximu m demand for the sole purpose of determining the customer’s eligibility  for Schedule B - 20.  The Generation Demand Adjustment does not sp ecifically guarantee the customer’s  continued eligibility for service under this schedule nor will it be applied to the c ustomer’s  maximum demand for purposes of calculating the monthly maximum demand charge.  Option S for Storage:   The Option S rate for s torage is available to qualifying Bundled, DA  and CCA service under Schedule B - 20 customers with storage systems with a r ated capacity  in watts which is at least 10% of the customer’s peak demand over the previous 12 months.  Option S is available subject   to an enrollment cap. For additional Option S details and  program specifics, sett Sections 3 and 18.  Peak Day Pricing De fault Rates : Peak Day Pricing (PDP) rates provide customers the  opportunity to manage their electric costs by reducing load during high cost perio ds or shifting  load from high cost periods to lower cost periods . Decision 10 - 02 - 032 ordered that beginning  May 1, 2010, eligible large Commercial and Industrial (C&I) customers default to PDP rates.  A customer is eligible for default when 1) it has at l east twelve (12) months of hourly usage  data available, and 2) i t has measured demands equal to or exceeding   200 kW for three (3)  consecutive months during the past 12 months. All eligible customers will be placed on PDP  rate s   unless they opt - out to a TOU   rate.  Decision   10 - 02 - 032, as modified by Decision 11 - 11 - 008, or d e red that beginning November 1,  2014, eligib le small and medium C&I customers (those with demands that are not equal to or  greater than 200 kW for three consecutive months) default to PDP rates . A customer is  eligible for default when it has at least twe l v e (12) billing months of hourly usage data  available and two years of experience on TOU rates. All eligible customers will be placed on  PDP rates unless they opt - out to a TOU rate. Customers   with a SmartMeter TM   system, or  interval meter, installed that   c an be remotely read by PG&E may also volunt arily elect to enroll  on PDP rates.  Bundled service customers are eligible for PDP. Direct Access (DA) and Comm unity Choice  Aggregation (CCA) service customers are not eligible, including those DA customers on  transitional bundled service (TBS). Customer s on standby service (Schedule SB) whose  premises are regularly supplied in full by electric energy from a nonut ility source of supply,  net - energy metering Schedules NEMFC, NEMBIO, NEMCCSF, or NEMA, or an energy  payment demand response program are not elig ible for PDP. Customers that take   standby  service whose premises   are regularly supplied in part (but not in fu ll) by electric energy from a  nonutility source of supply are eligible for PDP on the   non - standby   p ortion of their service. In  addition, master - metered customers are not eligible, except for commercial buildings with  submetering as stated in PG&E Rule 1   and Rule 18.

Kenney   Effective   March 1, 2021  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  3.   RATES:  (Cont’d.)  a.   TYPES OF CHARGES: The customer’s monthly charge for service under  Schedule   B - 20 is the sum of a customer charge, demand charges, and energy  charges:  The   customer charge   is a flat monthly fee.  –   Schedule   B - 20 has three   demand charges , a maximum - peak - period - demand  charge, a maximum - part - peak - period demand charge, and a maximum - demand  charge. The maximum - peak - period - demand charge per kilowatt applies to the  maximum demand during the month’s peak hours, the maximum - part - peak -  demand char ge per kilowatt applies to the maximum demand during the month’s  part - peak hours, and the maximum - demand charge per kilowatt applies to the  maximum demand at any time during the month. The bill will include   all   of these  demand charges. Option S includes   variations of these basic demand charge  types assessed on a (1) daily basis by time period and (2) maximum monthly  basis applied to all hours except 9 am to 2 pm. (Time periods are defined in  Section   6.)  –   The   energy charge   is the sum of the energy charges   from the peak, partial -  peak, and off - peak periods. The customer pays for energy by the kilowatt - hour  (kWh), and rates are differentiated according to time of day and time of year.  –   The monthly charges may be increased or decreased based upon the power  f actor.

DEFINITION  OF SERVICE  VOLTAGE:  The following defines the three   voltage classes of Schedule   B - 20   rates. Standard Service  Voltages are listed in Rule   2.  a.   Secondary : This is the voltage class if the service voltage is less than 2,400   volts or if  the de finitions of “primary” and “transmission” do not apply to the service.  b.   Primary : This is the voltage class if the customer is served from a “single customer  substation” or   without transformation   from PG&E’s serving distribution system at one  of the stan dard primary voltages specified in PG&E’s Electric Rule   2, Section   B.1.  c.   Transmission : This is the voltage class if the customer is served   without  transformation   at one of the standard transmission voltages specified in PG&E’s  Electric Rule   2, Section   B .1.  ( L )  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  6.   DEFINITION  OF TIME  PERIODS:  Times of the year and times of the day are defined as follows:  SUMMER   -   Service from June   1 through September   30:  Peak:   4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.   Every day, including weekends  and holidays  Partial - peak:   2:00   p .m. to 4:00 pm AND  9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  Every day, including weekends  and holidays  Off - peak:   All other Hours.

The power factor is computed from  the cosine of the arctangent of the ratio of lagging reactive kilovolt - ampere - hours to the  kilowatt - hours consumed in the month. Power   factors are rounded to the nearest whole  percent.  The rates in this rate schedule are based on a power factor of 85   percent. If the average  power factor is greater than 85 percent, the total monthly bill will be reduced by the product  of the power factor   rate and the kilowatt - hour usage for each percentage point above  85   percent. If the average power factor is below 85   percent, the total monthly bill will be  increased by the product of the power factor rate and the kilowatt - hour usage for each  percentage   point below 85   percent.  Power factor adjustments will be assigned to distribution for billing purposes.  ( L )  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  8.

STANDARD  SERVICE  FACILITIES:  If PG&E must install any new or additional facilities to provide the customer with service  under Schedule   B - 20,   the customer may have to pay some of the cost. Any advance  necessary and any monthly charge for the facilities will be specified in a line extension  agreement. See Rules   2, 15, and 16 for details.  Facilities installed to serve the customer may be removed   when service is discontinued.  The customer will then have to repay PG&E for all or some of its investment in the facilities.  Terms and conditions for repayment will be set forth in the line extension agreement.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  10.   SPECIAL  FACILITIES:  PG&E will normally install only those standard facilities it deems necessary to provide  service under Schedule   B - 20. If the customer requests any additional facilities, those  facilities will be treated as “special facilities” in accordance with Section   I   of Rule   2.  |  |  |  ( L )\n\nU 39   Oakland , California  Revised   Cal.

Option R   The Option R rate is available to qualifying customers with   eligible technologies as  described   in   the   applicability   section   of   this   tariff.   Across   all   applicable   rate  schedules, Option R participation is capped at 600 MW of generating or stor age  discharge capacity. Eligible Permanent Load   Shift (PLS) technologies are not  subject to this cap.  For eligible stand - alone storage, the qualifying capacity counted towards the  Option R cap is the discharge capacity of the s torage system or systems,  cal culating using the same method as is used for Option S.  For eligible renewable technologies, the qualifying capacity counted towards the  Option R participation cap is based on net renewable generating capacity (i.e., the  amount   of power actually delivered   by the generator or generators net of any  losses such as auxiliary loads, thermal management loads, etc.).  For paired storage systems, the qualifying capacity counted towards the Option R  cap is the larger of the system’s Calif ornia Energy Commission (CEC)   alternating  current (AC) solar capacity or the discharge capacity of the storage system  calculated using the same method as that used for Option S (but not both). No  Benefitting* or Aggregated* account is eligible for Option R   unless there is an  eligible   technology interconnected at that account that independently meets the  Option R minimum size requirements relative to peak load, as described in the  applicability section of this tariff.

Kenney   Effective   March 1, 2021  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  1 7 . OPTIMAL  BILLING  PERIOD  SERVICE:  The Optimal Billing Period (OBP) service is a voluntary program available to  bundled, direct access and community choice aggregation customers taking  service on Schedule   B - 19 or Schedule B - 20. To qualify, a meter must ha ve  registered a demand of 500 kW or greater at least once during the most recent 12  months. The OBP service is limited to 50 service accounts with interval billed  meters.  Customers electing this service must complete the “Optimal Billing Period Service  Ele ction Form” (Form 79 - 1111).  Decision 18 - 08 - 013 expanded the eligibility of OBP to Schedule   B - 19 (above 500  kW as defined above), Schedule B - 20, and to   DA and CCA   customers taking  service on eligible schedules. Decision 18 - 08 - 013 retained the participation   cap of  50 positions, and reserved 36 positions for agricultural accounts, and 14 positions  for commercial and industrial accounts. Before declining participation of any  otherwise eligible account based on these participation limits, PG&E will verify that  all other enrolled accounts are still eligible for the program.  Customers on net energy metering Schedules VNEM, NEMBIO, NEMFC,  NEMCCSF, NEMA or RES - BCT are not eligible for OBP service.  The OBP service allows a billing cycle(s) to coincide with the cust omer’s high  seasonal production cycle. The customer designates the OBP by selecting one or  both of the following:  a) a specific month and day for the start of the OBP; and/or  b) a specific month and day for the end of the OBP.  PG&E will use the customer ’s usage from the preceding twelve (12) billing months  to determine eligibility for the OBP service. To qualify, the average of the previous  high season monthly maximum demand must be at least double the average of  the low season monthly maximum demand.   The customer must also specify  which six consecutive months will be their high season optimal billing period.  The start and end dates must fall within the customer’s high seasonal production  cycle. In no event shall any revised billing period exceed forty - five (45) days or be  less than fifteen (15) days. To qualify for this option, the customer must designate  an OBP of not more than six (6) months in duration.  To designate the specific date for the start or end of the OBP, a participating  customer must ema il PG&E at least seventy - two (72) hours in advance and such  email shall state in its subject line “OBP Notification.” The designation may not be  implemented if it is not received or if it does not contain the specified information.

Prior to receiving OBP service, the customer must pay an annual OBP fee of  $160.00 per meter. In order to retain the OBP service option in each subsequent  year, the annual participation fee must be recei ved by   PG&E by the anniversary  date of the contract. PG&E will bill the annual OBP fee upon the anniversary date  of the contract unless the customer terminates the contract. For billing purposes,  the annual participation fee shall be assigned to Distribu tion.  A. No Retroactive Application  No customer shall be entitled to a refund associated with the OBP service for costs  that might have been avoided had the service been available at an earlier point in  time.  B. Customer Notification to PG&E  A customer mu st hav e at least 12 months of usage on a specific meter before the  OBP service can be received on that particular meter. Also, a customer must  provide notice to PG&E of their intention to obtain OBP service at least ninety (90)  days before the start of th e prog ram.

OPTION S   The Option S rate for storage is available to qualifying customers taking Bundled, DA or  CCA service under Schedule B - 2 0   or voluntary B - 20 .   Eligible customers must have storage  systems with rated capacity in watts which is at least 10% of   t he customer’s peak demand  over the previous 12 months.   Customers do not need to participate in the Self Generation  Incentive Program to participate in this program.  The cap for Option S enrollment will be considered reached when the MW value hits 50 MW  per rate schedule, separately for B - 19V , B - 19   and B - 20 .  For purposes of determining eligibility for Option S, the usage of the customer over the  previous 12 months will be determined by the max demand.   St orage   rated capacity will be  determined by PTO agr eement.  When a customer first moves to a location with installed storage, the minimum 30 days of  usage history required to evaluate whether the battery capacity is at least 10% of the  customer’s peak demand   will not yet   be available. Thus, qualifying cust omers starting a  B - 20   Service Agreement at a new location will not be on Option S on day 1 of their new SA  activation.  The rated capacity (W) for energy storage technologies is calculated as follows:  •   DC/AC   systems: The   nominal voltage multiplied by the am p - hour capacity  multiplied by the applicable efficiency divided by the duration of discharge ((VDC x  Amp - Hours x (1 kW/1000W) x Applicable Efficiency) / Duration of Discharge).  o   The following specifications m ust be provi ded to calculate rated capacity:  ▪   Dura t ion of discharge (hours)  ▪   DC dischargeable amp   - hour capacity, associated with the  duration of discharge specified, including all losses and ancillary  loads (such as power conditioning and thermal management)  ▪   Nominal vol tage (VDC)  ▪   Applicable efficiency (if   n ecessary), which accounts for  conversion, transformation, or other efficiency losses (e.g.  Inverter CEC weighted efficiency, DC - DC converter efficiency,  etc.) systems, this is rated in DC, and for AC system s, this is  r ated in AC.  ▪   The continuous maximum po   w er output capability of the system.  For DC systems, this is rated in DC, and for AC systems, this is  rated in AC.  The following are not eligible for Option S:  o   100% Standby customers  o   SAs enrolled in Option R   are not eli gible for Option S and vice versa  o   SAs   on Virtual NEM, NEM Aggregation, NEMBIO, NEMFC, RES - BCT  o   Customers with EMR meters  Note: PG&E expects to be able to allow customers to take service on Schedule E -  BIP with Option S by   March 31,   2020.

In March 2022, customers who   are enrolled in the version of PDP with  5:00   p.m.   –   8:00 p.m. PDP Event Hours (5   to   8 PDP) will be   transitioned   to a  new version of PDP with 4:00 p.m.   –   9:00 p.m. PDP Event Hours   (4 to 9 PDP) .  Starting in March 2021, 5 to 8 PDP will be discontinued, and 4   to 9 PDP will b e  available only on the new rates with later TOU hours.  Pursuant to a modification granted by the CPUC Executive   Director by letter  dated June 14, 2021, PG&E was allowed an extension to March 2022 to default  eligible non - residential and no n - agricultural c u s tomers to PDP rate plans as  required by Ordering Paragraph 1 of D.10 - 02 - 032 and Ordering Paragraph 1(d)  of D.11 - 11 - 008.  Bun dled service Net Energy Metering (NEM) customers taking   servi ce on  Schedule NEM, NEMV, NEMVMASH, NEM2, NEM2V, or NE M2VMSH are  eligi b l e for default to PDP and   to   opt - in to PDP. NEM customers on NEMBIO,  NEM FC, NEMCCS F, and NEMA are not eligible for PDP. The N EM Annual  True - Up billing date, and the first year PD P Bil l Stabilization date in section b  below, may be indepe ndent 12 - month p e r iods. After the first year on PDP,  NEM credits can offset PDP charges.   PDP credi ts and charges will be  provided for exported   generation. All PDP billing for NEM customers will b e  bas ed on net usage during each 15 - minute interval.  b.   Capaci ty Reservation L e v el : Customers may elect a capacity reservation  level (CRL) and pay for a   fixed lev el of capacity, specified in kW. While the C RL  is applicable year round, customers electing a CRL   will   be billed on a take - or -  pay basis up to the specified   CRL under the no n - PDP rate of this schedule  during the summer period (June 1 through Septe mber 30).   This means that  customers will be billed for   summer peak generation demand charges up to the  leve l of   their CRL, even in summer months when the actual deman d might be  less   t h an their CRL. Customers will receive PDP credits on summer usage  above t he CRL on   all summer - period days. All usage during a P DP event  protected under the CRL will be billed at th e non - PDP rate. All usage above the  CRL (as measured in 15 - minute intervals ) ,   and not protected during a PDP  event, will be billed at the PDP rate. I f a custom er fails to elect an initial CRL,  the custom er’s initial CRL will be set at 50% of its most recen t   full   summer  s e ason   average peak - period maximum demand and   may go back to   t h e  previous year to make a full summer season (if available). If the   customer h as  not established any historic summer billi ng demand, the CRL will be set at zero  (0). The CRL f or a l l customers, including NEM customers, must be greater than  or equal to zer o   (0). A customer may only elect to change their CRL once every  12 - mon ths.

Kenney   Effective   October 16, 2021  Vice President, Regulatory Affairs   Resolution  1 9.   PEAK DAY  PRICING  DETAILS  (Cont ’ d.):  c.   Bill Stabilization : PDP customers will be offered bill stabilization for the initial  twelve (12) months unless they opt - out during their initial 45 - day period. Bill  stabilization ensures that during the initial 12 - months under PDP, the customer  will not pay more than it would have had it opted - out to the applicable TOU rate.  If a customer terminates its participation on the PDP rate prior to the initial 12 -  month perio d expiring, the customer will receive bill stabil ization up to the date  when the customer terminates its participation. Bill stabilization benefits will be  computed on a cumulative basis, based on the earlier of 1) when a customer  terminates its participa tion on the PDP rate or 2) at the end of the init ial 12 -  month period. Any applicable credits will be applied to the customer’s account  on a subsequent regular bill. Bill stabilization is only available one time per  customer. If a customer un - enrolls or   terminates its participation on a PDP  rate, bill   stabilization will not be offered again.  Active 5 to 8 PDP customers who have not completed 12 - months of bill  stabilization   by the time they are transitioned to 4 to 9 PD P in their March 202 2  billing cycle will seamlessly continue with their bill stabiliza tion under 4 to 9  PDP until 12 - months have elapsed since their initial enrollment in 5 to 8 PDP,  or until they optionally unenroll from 4 to 9 PDP before 12 - months.  5 t o 8 PDP customers who have already received 12 - months of bill  stabilization , will not   receive bill stabilization   for a second time when they are  transitioned to   4 to 9 PDP.  d.   Notification Equipment : At the customer’s option and expense, it is  recommended, but not required that a customer provide   a phone number or an  e - mail address to re ceiv e a utomated   voice, text, or em ail   notification messages  of a PDP event from PG&E.  If a PDP event occurs, customers will be notified using one or more of the  above - mentioned systems. Receipt of such notice is the responsibility of   the  participating c usto mer . PG&E will make reas onable efforts to notify customers,  however it is the customer’s responsibility to receive such notice and to check  the PG&E website to see if a PDP event has been activated. It is also the  customer’s respo nsibility to maintai n ac cur ate notification conta ct information.  PG&E does not guarantee the reliability of the phone, e - mail system, or Internet  site by which the customer receives notification.  PG&E may conduct notification test events once a month to e nsure a  customer’s c onta ct   information is up - to - d ate. These are not actual PDP events  and no load reduction is required.  e.   PG&E Website:   The customer’s actual energy usage is available at PG&E’s  “Your Account” website. This data may not match billing qual ity data, and the  cu stom er   understands and agrees   that the data posted to PG&E’s “Your  Account” website may be different from the actual bill.

Program Operations : A maximum of fifteen (15) PDP events and a   minimum  of nine (9) PDP events may be called in any calendar year. PG&E will notify  customers by   4 :00 p.m. on a day - ahead basis when a PDP event will o ccur the  next day. The PDP program will operate year - round and PDP events may be  called for any day of   the week.  PG&E may conduct outreach/notification by any available channel (direct mail,  phone call,   email and/or text) for PDP customers.  g.   Event Cancella tion or Redu ction:   PG&E may initiate the cancellation of a  PDP event before   5 :00 p.m. the day - ahead of a noticed PDP event. If PG&E  cancels an event, it will count the cancelled event toward the PDP limits.  PG&E may also cancel   PDP ev ents by   5 :00   p.m. o n a day - ahead basis or   on  the Event Day i tself in response to an emergency situation, such as a  proclamation of a state of emergency and/or disaster by a local, state and/or  federal government.  h.   Event Trigger:   PG& E will tr igger a PDP e vent when th e day - a head  temperature forecast trigger is reached. The trigger will be the average of the  day - ahead maximum temperature forecasts for San Jose, Concord, Red Bluff,  Sacramento and Fresno.  Beginning June 1 of each summer   season, t he PDP events   on non - holi day  wee kdays will be triggered at 98 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and will be triggered  at 105°F on holidays and weekends. If needed, PG&E will adjust the non -  holiday weekday trigger up or down over the course of the summer t o achieve  the range of   9 to 15 PDP   events   in any calendar year. Such adjustments would  be made no more than twice per month and would be posted on PG&E’s PDP  Website.  PDP events may also be initiated as warranted on a day - ahead basis by 1)  extreme system   condition s such as spe cial alerts   issued   by the California  Independent System Operator, 2) under conditions of high forecasted California  spot market power prices, 3) to meet annual PDP event limits for a calendar  year, or 4) for testing/evaluation purpose s.  i.   Prog ram Terms:   A   customer ma y opt - o ut anytime during its initial 12 - months  on a PDP rate. After the initial 12 - months, customer’s participation will be in  accordance with Electric Rule 12.  Customers may opt - out of a PDP rate at anytime to enroll in   another   demand  respon se program b eginnin g May 1, 2011.  j.   Interaction with Other PG&E Demand Response Programs:   Pursuant to  D.18 - 11 - 029, customers on a PDP rate may no longer participate in another  demand response program offered by PG&E or a third - party   demand re sponse  provid er as of Oct ober 26 , 2018. If dual enrolled in BIP and PDP prior to  October 26, 2018 then participation will be capped at the customer’s subscribed  megawatt level as of December 10, 2018. New dual enrollment in BIP and  PDP as of Oct ober 26,   2018 is no lo nger availab le. If   a NEM customer is on  PDP, the customer cannot participate in a third - party Demand Response  program unless it ceases to be a PDP customer. If a third - party signs a NEM  customer up under Rule 24 at the CAISO, the cus tomer is   automatically  removed fro m PDP.  (T)  (T)  (T)",

An   electric vehicle includes light - duty, medium - duty, and heavy - duty  battery electric vehicles and plug - in hybrid electric vehicles, as well as off - road  electric ve hicles and off - road electric equipment.   This schedule is not available to  residential or agri cultural service for cust omers for which a residential or  agricultural schedule is applicable with the exception of Multi - Family  Accommodations as defined in Electric Rule 1 1 , which qualify as commercial  premises for purposes of BEV rate applicability.  Ser vice under this schedule   is provided at the sole option of PG&E and based  upon the availability of metering equipment and customer infrastructure  improvements necessary for charging (see “Special Conditions” section, item 10).  The BEV   rate has two dis tinct rate options: BEV - 1 and BEV - 2. The BEV - 1 rate  option is   int ended for   customers with kW usage at or below 100 kW. T he BEV - 2  rate   option   is   in tended for   customers with kW usage at or above 100 kW. N ote  that customers   may be on the BEV - 1 or BE V - 2 at   usage of 100 kW based on the  customer’s preference. BEV - 1 is for Secondary Voltage service, and BEV - 2 was  designed with   Primary an d Secondary Voltage option s . Transmission Voltage  customers are eligible   for enrollment on   the BEV - 2 Primary rate   option .  Th e   BEV rate replaces the customer charge and traditional maximum kW demand  charge with a subscription - based model for monthly kW allocation.   Customers  taking service on this rate schedule can use any amount of kW   and kWh but will  incur an “overage” fee if   t he kW usage exceeds a customer’s self - designated  subscription level. The specific mechanics of the subscription model and overage  fee are   described in more detail in the “Special Conditions” section   item 6 and   item  8.

W ILDFIRE FUND CHARGE:   The Wildfire Fund Charge was imposed by  California Public Utilities Commission Decisions 19 - 10 - 056, 20 - 07 - 014,  20 - 09 - 005, and 20 - 09 - 023   and is property of Department of Water Resources  (DWR) for all purp oses under California law. The   Charge became effective  October 1, 2020, and applies to all retail sales, excluding CARE and Medical  Baseline sales. The Wildfire Fund Charge (where applicable) is included in  customers’ total billed amounts. The Wildfire   Fund Charge replaces the DWR  Bo nd Charge imposed by California Public Utilities Commission Decisions  02 - 10 - 063 and 02 - 12 - 082 .  6.   SUBSCRIPTION: The kW subscription component of the BEV replaces a kW  demand charge.   The BEV rate does not include demand or custo mer charges  and   instead uses a monthly subscription for customer’s kW   demand. The  subscription comes in blocks of 10 kW for the BEV - 1 rate   option   and in blocks  of 50 kW or the BEV - 2 rate   option . A customer determines their e stimated  maximum kW demand and   then selects a   subscription l evel to suit their need.  7.   G RAC E   PERIOD:   A grace period is a period of three (3) billing cycles , each  with a minimum of 27 days,   in which a BEV customer is not   subject to overage  fees (see “Special Conditions” section, item 8)   as sociated with exceeding the  customer’s monthl y pre - defined k W subscription. A grace period is triggered  under   the following two conditions:  a.   Customer Enrollment : A grace period   is triggered when a customer  enrolls in a BEV rate.  b.   A ddit ion of Elect rical Vehicle Service Equipment ( EVSE):   After a  customer is enrolled in BEV rate, a second qualifying event for grace  periods is if an existing customer enrolled on the BEV ra te ( eit her  BEV - 1 or BEV - 2   rate option ) adds   additional charging   infrastructure  th at increases   load . In this case ,   a custome r must notify PG&E that  they have increased t he amount of EV SE infrastructure behind the  meter, which will then trigger a grace period.

GRACE PERIOD   ( Cont ’ d) :  Note that an automatic adjustment of a customer’s subscrip tion level may  occur at the end of a grace period for the following billing cycle. This  would only occur if the customer had exceeded their sub scription level on  the third (and last) billing cycle of the grace period, in which case their  subscription leve l for subsequent billing cycles would be automatically set  to the overage amount from the third billing cycle of the grace period  rounded up to   the nearest kW block of subscription. The customer would  be eligible to modify the subscription level again aft er three consecutive  billing cycles following the end of the grace period.  8.   OVERAGE/OVERAGE FEE: An ove rage is incurred when a customer  sur passes the kW allotment of their pre - determined subscription level outside  of a grace period. Note that the   customer’s subscription level is determined by  the customer and can be increased or decreased as the customer se es fit.  The only exception to this   is the case of a “lock out” when PG&E auto adjusts  the customer on the fourth month of billing following a c ustomer overage in the  third billing period within the grace period.  Overage will be based on 15 - minute interval s readings of the average kW  usage.   For example, a customer with a 50 kW subscription whose average  demand exceeds 50 kW in a given 15 - minute i nterval of the billing cycle is  considered to have incurred an overage.  If a customer exceeds their subscriptio n after the grace period, PG&E will   bill  them for their subscription amount and any overages in increments of 1 kW.  Although a customer may exce ed their pre - determined kW subscription level  multiple times per billing period, a customer can only incur one ( 1) financial  penalty associated with   overage for each billing period. Overage fees are  based on the maximum kW demand in a given billing period.   For example, if a  customer with a 60 kW subscription uses 61 kW of demand in a 15 - minute  window followed by a   65 kW of demand in another 15 - minute   window, the  customer will only incur an overage fee for the 5 kW overage for that billing  period. Note: In   some cases, such as rate version changes or seasonal cross  overs, more than one billing period may be included i n a general PG&E billing  cycle.

NOTIFICATIONS: Customer agrees to provide and maintain at least one form  of accurate notification for billing and financial related customer messages,  which may include email or Short Message Service (“SMS”). If Customer  subsequently opts out of SMS notifications, customer must agree to provide a  current email for BEV notifications, such as overage fees, in order to be  eligible for the rate.  10.   METER: Customers eligible for this rate schedule must have an interval data  meter that can be read remotely by PG& E. In addition, MV90 meters are  eligible for the BEV starting   rate .  Where electricity is furnished for Electric Vehicle charging, a Customer may  use an EV submeter to measure Electric Vehicle charge load, and ancillary  Electric Vehicle charge service (i.e., demand response, vehicle - grid  integration, etc.). All EV submeters used for submetering purposes must be  approved by PG&E and meet the requirements established in Decision 22 - 08 -  024, Decision Adopting Plug - in Electric Vehicle Submetering Protocol and  Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Communication Protocols.  11.   SERVICE VOLTAGE: Please refer to Electric Rule 2 for information regarding  service delivery voltages.  12.   NEM ELIGIBILITY :   Bundled and unbundled Net Energy Metering (NEM)  customers taking service on NEM2S, NEM2EXP, NEM2EXPM, NEM2MT and  NEM2PS are eligible for the BEV rate.  13.   INTEGRAL LOAD: Any loads that are solely associated with EV charging and  no other use. Any loads associated with Generating Facilities (as defined in  Rule 21) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) that are used solely to  offset or support the EV charging loads are considered integral loads. Note:  These systems should be sized appropriately to only serve the integral and  eligible incidental EV charging loads, as well as accommodate future EV  charging loads on the BEV meter and no other loads.  14.   INCIDENTAL LOAD: Any loads that are not considered integral loads but are  dedicated exclusively to support the safe operation of the overall EV site  infrastructure (e.g., lighting solely dedicated to the charging station, fire  abatement systems, charging outlets for fleet maintenance power tools) may  be included as loads on the BEV - dedicated meter. All incidental loads must  be solely and exclusively dedicated to their associated EV charging  infrastructure and will be reviewed at the option of and as determined by  PG&E.  15.   PEAK DAY PRICING   PDP)   ELIGIBILITY : Customers taking service on BEV  are not eligible to participate in PDP as BEV rate already accounts for high  differentials between peak and non - peak periods;   so   there   i s no opportunity for  further differentiation with PDP overlay.

Introduction  1.1. Purpose  Site-level normalized metered energy consumption (site-level NMEC) is the methodology for estimating energy and demand savings for two program offerings from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), the Public Sector NMEC offering and the Commercial Whole Building (CWB) NMEC offering. Given the diverse range of premises, energy efficiency measures (EEMs), modeling algorithms, and other factors that may influence the potential outcome of site-level NMEC projects, both PG&E and its regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) require that implementers wishing to participate in these programs submit a site-level M&V Plan for each project application package that meets PG&E’s requirements. This document describes the requirements for project-level M&V plans, savings reports, and serves as a reference for implementers wishing to participate in these two PG&E NMEC program offerings. As such, this document serves the role of a program level M&V plan for these types of projects.  The quantification of achieved energy and demand savings after the installation of EEMs is based on the analysis of pre- and post-installation metered energy data. The savings methodology follows the established Option C Whole Building approach as documented in the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP). 1   Under the Public Sector and the CWB offerings, savings will be determined for each project following guidance and requirements for site-level NMEC projects as documented by the CPUC (CPUC Rulebook 2.0). 2   Each project will have its own project-level M&V plan that complies with the guidance and requirements described in this program-level plan and describes specific details and methods to be employed for that project. Each project-level M&V Plan shall include the proposed data collection, analysis methodologies, and documentation for an individual project, including project pre-screening, savings determination, and reporting.  This M&V plan will apply to a variety of building NMEC projects, each of which addresses different equipment, operating schedules, changes impacting energy use, metering and data resources, and levels of savings. For consistency among savings calculations and incentive payments, PG&E will employ the same meter-based savings analysis methodology and procedures to calculate claimable and payable savings across all projects. Implementers are welcome to use their own methods in their interactions with customers, however incentives will be based on PG&E’s analysis. Implementers are welcome to use PG&E’s methods as well. As we gain more experience with specific customers, modeling methods, and premise types, we expect to expand specific methodologies beyond current requirements.  1   International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Efficiency Valuation Organization,   www.evo-world.org .  2   Rulebook for Programs and Projects Based on Normalized Metered Energy Consumption, version 2.0, January 7, 2020, available at   https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442456320 .\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  4  1.2. Background Information  The site-level NMEC methodology has long been established in two well-known industry guidelines: IPVMP (Option C) and ASHRAE Guideline 14. 3   The IPMVP describes best practices for different savings verification approaches while the ASHRAE Guideline 14 provides more detailed technical requirements. With the widespread availability of electric and natural gas energy use data measured in short-time intervals (e.g., sub-hourly, hourly, and daily) from advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the PG&E territory, and development of more accurate energy modeling algorithms, 4   meter-based approaches have been employed in efficiency projects with great accuracy and success. The AMI data and advanced modeling algorithms have enabled more timely feedback on a building’s energy use and savings achievements and have provided insight on the identification and treatment of non-routine events (NREs). The NMEC Savings Procedures Manual 5   describes the fundamental process and requirements in each site-level NMEC project phase, incorporating the well-established guidance of the IPMVP and ASHRAE documents, and updated with more recent developments in energy modeling.  The approach detailed in this plan was developed based on guidance provided by LBNL to the CPUC 6  and requirements set forth in CPUC Proceeding A.17-01-013 for measure cost-effectiveness, measure EUL, and behavioral, retro-commissioning, and operational (BRO) measure requirements. Implementers are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the approaches, methods, and data requirements described in this M&V Plan and review the guidance documents provided by PG&E in its Platform Rulebook 7   and by the CPUC Rulebook 2.0 to gain a full understanding of the fundamental requirements of site-level NMEC offerings.  2.   Project Approach and Process  This document describes how individual projects will be accepted into the Public Sector NMEC and CWB program offerings, how project-level M&V will be carried out, how CPUC requirements will be fulfilled, and  3   American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guideline 14-2014 Measurement of Energy and Demand Savings.

This section first describes the site-level NMEC M&V project procedures and documentation requirements, then addresses the broader program-level requirements.  There are three periods of activity in each project: the baseline, installation, and performance periods. Pre-screening and project development take place in the baseline period, EEMs are installed and verified in the installation period, and savings are determined and documented in the performance period. These M&V activities are illustrated within the three periods in Figure 1. For more information for how these activities fit in the overall program process please refer to the program offering manual.  1.   Baseline Period:  a.   Pre-screening.   Each potential project is pre-screened for eligibility. The facility’s condition is assessed to make sure it is not in need of major repairs and upgrades. Potential efficiency measures are identified and their potential for deep savings assessed (high level assessment, no detailed calculations). An energy model is developed from a year of energy use and temperature data and an assessment of building predictability is made. The potential for non-routine events is assessed. The customer’s desire to participate in a pay for performance approach is documented. PG&E decides whether the project is a good candidate for the NMEC platform.  b.   Feasibility Study and M&V Plan Development.   Implementers develop the project by identifying specific EEMs and estimating their savings. A feasibility study is completed to describe the facility, its equipment and operations, recommended savings measures, their savings-weighted useful life, and how the program influenced the customer. The required program information and data is collected. A project-level M&V plan is developed that documents specifically how data will be collected and how savings will be quantified for the project based on program requirements, including how risks will be managed.  2.   Installation Period.   Following acceptance of the project by PG&E, the customer installs the EEMs. A post-installation report is completed to document the as-installed EEMs and updates to the weighted useful life. Partial payments of incentives are made.  3.   Performance Period.   During the performance period, energy data is collected, achieved savings are determined, normalized savings are reported, and incentives are paid.  Figure 1 illustrates what activities take place in the baseline, installation, and performance periods of the individual projects. A project’s baseline model is developed using energy use and ambient temperature data from a baseline period of one year. This model is used to determine what energy use would have been in the performance period absent the intervention (called adjusted baseline energy use) as represented by the black line. The difference between the adjusted baseline use and the energy use as observed at the meter during the performance period is the savings expressed as avoided energy use. At the end of the 12-month performance period, the normalized savings is determined. This requires development of a model based on performance period data, so that both baseline and performance\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  6  period energy may be normalized to long term weather conditions as required by CPUC (referred to as CALEE 2018 weather data). 8   Incentives are based on the normalized savings.  Figure 1. NMEC Project Process  2.1. Baseline Period  Project Predictability Report. As described in the Program Manual, each potential project is pre-screened  for eligibility. The principal M&V activity is to assure the meter-based M&V approach can accurately account for the project’s savings. The building’s ‘predictability’ is determined by collecting a year of energy use, weather, and other potentially influential variable data, which is then analyzed to determine whether an acceptable energy model may be developed that meets the eligibility requirements. These modeling criteria are: 9  •   Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Squared Error:   𝐶𝑉(𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸) < 25%  •   Net Mean Bias Error:   −0.5 < 𝑁𝑀𝐵𝐸 < 0.5%  8   CPUC’s NMEC Rulebook 2.0 requires CALEE2018 weather data for normalization and is available at:  http://www.calmac.org/weather.asp .  9   Descriptions and recommended values of the modeling goodness-of-fit metrics are recommended in “Site-Level NMEC Technical Guidance: Program M&V Plans Utilizing Normalized Metered Energy Consumption Savings Estimation, Version 2.0, December 15, 2019” provided to CPUC by LBNL. CV(RMSE) is a measure of model random error, NMBE is a measure of model bias error, and   R 2   is an indication of how well the independent variables ‘explain’ the dependent variable.

All suspected NREs should be confirmed with the participant and confirmed baseline period NREs must be documented in the predictability report, with a description of how their impacts may be addressed should the project be accepted into the program. Section 3.10 describes some methods and external resources for NRE detection and savings adjustments.  A predictability report template is provided in Appendix 2.  Project Feasibility Study. The Program Manual describes the project feasibility study, which provides a  more in-depth assessment of potential energy efficiency measures and provides information to meet the requirements set forth by the CPUC. This study includes an energy audit to identify and assess the cost- effectiveness and feasibility of EEMs.  The annual expected total savings for the recommended measures and the annual baseline period energy use for both electric and natural gas is reported in the feasibility study. To assure savings are detectable above model noise, the program targets 10% savings of baseline year electric and natural gas consumption. If lower than 10% savings for each energy commodity are anticipated, the feasibility study should describe how the meter-based analysis may be used to quantify the savings at an acceptable certainty level.  A feasibility report template is provided with the Program Manual.  Project-Level M&V Plan. A project-level M&V Plan shall be delivered with each project feasibility study  and follow CPUC Rulebook guidance. This M&V Plan shall describe:  •   A data collection plan documenting where data is collected from and how it is prepared for analysis  •   The building’s utility meters or participant-owned submeters, including electric, natural gas, or energy delivered from a central plant (chilled or hot water and steam).  o   Utility meter ID numbers  o   Sub-meter calibration requirements and recent calibration documentation  o   Description of systems and equipment served by each meter and submeter  •   Documentation of how EEMs will be verified as installed and operating  •   Description of the modeling algorithms, and software used to develop the building’s baseline energy models (see Modeling Methods).  •   The baseline energy model’s goodness-of-fit and accuracy metrics, showing how they meet the offering’s criteria  •   Assessment of expected savings uncertainty and how savings will be detectable at an acceptable level of certainty  10   Why   r 2   Doesn’t Matter, M Stetz P.E., CMVP, M&V Focus, EVO’s Measurement & Verification Magazine, October 2019.   https://evo-world.org/en/news-media/m-v-focus/868-m-v-focus-issue-5/1164- why-r2-doesn-t-matter\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  8  •   Documentation of how baseline period NREs were identified and how they were analyzed for the baseline period models  •   Documentation of static factors and they will be tracked to identify potential NREs, and how anticipated NREs occurring in the installation and performance periods will be identified and impacts removed from the final savings estimation (see Section 3.10)  •   How savings will be documented and reported after twelve months of the performance period  •   How all data and savings calculations used to determine the meter-based savings estimations will be made available.  •   How often savings progress reports will be documented and provided to the participant and to PG&E  An M&V Plan Template is provided in Appendix 3.  2.2. Installation Period  Post-Installation Report. The duration of the installation period will be limited to 18 months, per CPUC  requirement. The participant must inform PG&E when the EEMs have been installed. The participant or implementer is responsible for verifying each installed measure and completing a post-installation report. The post-installation report describes the EEMs that were installed and updates the individual EEM energy savings estimates if the EEMs were installed differently than originally planned. It describes why some EEMs were not installed. It provides descriptions of how the EEMs were verified as performing efficiently. It provides full measure installation and project cost information for the installed EEMs, supported by receipts, contractor invoices, installed meter costs, and the customer’s own labor and materials spent on the project. Costs must be associated with each measure. It provides an updated savings weighted EUL calculation. Incentives may be calculated and included in the post-installation report.  Measure verification requirements may vary depending on the type of measure. For example, lighting (only lighting fixtures on the DLC OR eligible through the calculated or deemed programs are eligible) fixture upgrades may be verified by a count of replaced fixtures and recording the new fixture types and wattages. Control sequences may be verified with the use of building control system trended data, or from data collected by data loggers. Trend data provides the most direct evidence of the EEM’s improvement of systems and equipment energy performance. Photographs, contractor invoices, and other cost information should also be collected. Over time, these techniques for documenting measure performance may be used by building operators to demonstrate measure persistence.  A post-installation report is required. PG&E reserves the right to inspect and verify all information claimed in the post-installation report and send a representative to perform a site inspection.  Large projects (projects that are expected to receive over $50,000 in incentives) are required to document that savings are accruing. For large projects, the achieved savings at three months shall be determined with an avoided energy use calculation and compared with the expected savings at three months based on the installed EEMs and their revised savings calculations. Section 3.7 describes the avoided energy use analysis and savings progress report.  A post-install report template is available with the Program Manual.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  9  2.3. Performance Period  Savings Report. A savings report shall be provided after twelve months of the performance period has  elapsed. This report shall document the data collected and analysis used to estimate the normalized savings achieved by the project.  The savings report must contain a narrative description of the models used, meter calibration requirements and documentation for data from any sub meters used, identify the baseline period, document the actual measures installed and their expected savings, and document the modeling algorithms used, model goodness of fit metrics, and energy savings analysis. Any NREs identified and treated as part of the analysis must be documented. Savings must be reported as normalized savings using CALEE2018 weather data. This means a model based on post-installation period energy use and conditions must also be developed and documented. Normalized savings are described in Section 3.6.  Demand savings must also be determined using the most recent California statewide guidance DEER peak demand definition, and documentation included in the final savings report. Any deviations from planned M&V activities must be clearly identified and explained. Savings reports must also report project costs per the requirements described in the next section. Estimated incentives must be reported in savings reports according to the requirements in the Program Manual. All data and information, spreadsheets or analysis code used to determine savings must be provided for technical review and program evaluation. Calculations must be live, based on the data provided, and calculation methods must be transparent from raw data through final savings results. All documentation, data, and calculation tools must be provided with the savings report.  The contents of the savings report is specified in the M&V Plan and a savings report template is available in Appendix 5.  3.   Additional M&V Requirements  The following sections provide additional detail on the considerations and requirements to complete the M&V activities described in the baseline and performance periods.  3.1. Data Collection and Preparation  The project-level M&V Plans must include a section on data collection and preparation that describes:  1.   The baseline period duration that must be at least 12 months. Longer durations are acceptable for the purposes of increasing modeling accuracy or replacing significant missing or removed data in cases of poor data quality or occurrence of non-routine events.  2.   The meters serving the project measurement boundary must be clearly identified and labeled. The measurement boundary should include all the equipment to be improved in the project.  a.   Data from multiple meters serving equipment that is affected by the EEMs should be combined in the savings analysis.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  10  b.   If some meters serve equipment that will not be affected by the installation of EEMs and the equipment does not serve the same space as the affected equipment, their meters may be excluded from the project.  c.   The site-Level NMEC project may include additional buildings, such as a central heating and cooling plant that serves multiple buildings. For example, a chilled water system may be upgraded in the central plant while control strategies are implemented in the buildings air handlers. Data from the central plant and building electricity meters should be included in the M&V plans for these buildings. This will capture the interactive effects between the electricity use in the buildings as well as the central plant. Note that 10% savings should still be targeted for each meter in the project.  d.   In the case where on-site generation is present and serves the facility, the generation data should be collected and combined with the building energy use data to assure that all energy used by the building is used in the analysis. In addition, projects where non-IOU is present are required to follow the savings claim methodology at the analysis intervals stated in the non-IOU fuel source guidance document. 11  3.   The source of both dependent and independent variable data to be used throughout the project duration, how data will be collected from each source, and how often.  a.   Utility data must be indicated by meter identification or service agreement identification number and sources named, such as utility account representative or via green button connect.  i.   How the meters used in the analysis will be mapped to the customer accounts, premises, and measurement boundaries of the loads affected by the EEMs.  b.   Data from participant-owned meters must be identified and their accuracy specifications documented. Recent calibration documentation must be provided for meters that require periodic calibration. Minimum accuracy requirements must adhere to CPUC specifications, which are shown in Table 4 of the Program Manual. Meters undergoing in-situ calibration must describe the process and equipment used to calibrate the meter and how results were used to update meter readings.  c.   Weather station sources must be named and their distances from the project site listed. When alternate weather station data is used, a justification must be provided. When weather services are used, the name of the service and a description of how that service generates weather data for the building site must be included.  11   California Public Utilities Commission, Energy Division, November 6, 2015, Guidance Document: Energy Efficiency Savings at Sites with Non-IOU Fuel Sources.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  11  d.   Sources for other data (e.g. restaurant meals served data, key card swipes, water usage data, WiFi network usage levels, on-site generation, etc.) must be named and a discussion of the reliability of the data provided.  4.   How the implementer, PG&E, and participant will work together to ensure data is available throughout the project duration.  5.   How often energy use and independent variable data will be collected and prepared for analysis.  6.   What data quality issues were identified and how they were treated. Data quality issues include missing data – in small or large quantities, erroneous or outlier data, and repeated data values. The M&V Plan should have a clear description of how the raw data was prepared for analysis.  3.2. Model Development  Energy model development may be an iterative process. The goal is to develop the most accurate and reliable energy model for the duration of the project. Several factors must be considered to achieve an acceptable energy model, and include:  •   Selection of an appropriate baseline period to include conditions expected in the post-installation period. The CPUC Rulebook 2.0 allows no more than 18 months from the end of the baseline period to the beginning of the performance period.  •   Influence on energy use of factors other than ambient temperature and availability of their data throughout the baseline, installation, and performance periods.  •   Presence of non-routine events and influences and methods to remove their impacts from the savings analysis.  •   Choice of modeling algorithm, number of independent variables, and time interval of data (hourly, daily, monthly billing period).  •   Model compliance with goodness of fit criteria.  •   Adherence of energy model to assumptions of regression modeling.  These considerations should be evaluated in the development of the baseline energy models. For consistency, the performance period energy model should use the same modeling algorithm, independent variables, time interval of data, and other considerations used to develop the baseline energy model.  3.3. Modeling Algorithms and Strategies  The savings analysis process begins with the development of a baseline period energy use model. Because the main influences on energy use in commercial and public sector buildings are ambient temperature, building operation schedule, and sometimes on occupancy load, preferred modeling\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  12  algorithms will be capable of including multiple independent variables. Two common public domain modeling algorithms are described below.  •   The time-of-week and temperature modeling algorithm (TOWT), which develops coefficients for each time-of-week and piecewise linear temperature segments specified in the model. TOWT accounts for the influence on energy use from the time-of-week as well as the ambient temperature. It may be applied using hourly of daily time interval data. This modeling algorithm was originally developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 7F  12   and has been modified and updated to include additional independent variables. A full description may be found in Appendix 1.  •   Modeling algorithms described in ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014, Table 5-1, which include the collection of temperature-dependent change-point models from ASHRAE Research Project 1050’s inverse modeling toolkit (IMT). 13   These algorithms may be applied with average temperatures or with heating or cooling degree days as the independent variable and may be applied with daily data.  Other modeling algorithms may be used to determine normalized savings. The site-level M&V plan must include a complete description of the algorithm, citing references as necessary, provide live calculation files that develop the energy models, and calculate their goodness of fit metrics (described below).  Different modeling strategies may be used to develop the energy models. One strategy is to use one modeling algorithm for the entire 12-month period but add additional independent variables. Additional independent variables may be continuous variables with values of the same time interval as the energy use (hourly, daily, or monthly billing period) or indicator variables which have values of 0 or 1 and are used for periods of time when buildings are in different operation modes, or for non-routine events (NREs). Additional independent variables may be used to explain the low-occupancy period of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, or other non-routine events in the building. They may be used if they are demonstrated to have statistical significance in explaining the energy use and their data is reliable and available throughout the NMEC project engagement.  Another common modeling strategy is to filter the energy data by distinct building operation modes and develop separate energy models for each mode, with the final baseline model comprising of all the models for each operation mode in the year. An example of an operation mode may be occupied hours and unoccupied hours, weekdays, weekends, holidays, and vacation periods. Operation modes may define when building HVAC operations operate differently than normal, such as a chiller being down for  12   Mathieu, et. at. 2011. “Quantifying Changes in Building Electricity Use, with Application to Demand Response,” LBNL report LBNL-49944E, April 2011.  13   Kissock, J.

The operation modes must be present in the performance period so that the proper baseline operation mode may be applied when determining the adjusted baseline use.  Each accepted energy model must pass the model acceptance criteria described below. The M&V plan shall document the modeling algorithm chosen, the modeling strategy employed, and describe how the model predictions will be made in the performance period, and how NREs will be identified and adjustments made to remove their impacts from the savings analysis. NREs are discussed in Section 3.10.  3.4. Model Goodness-of-Fit  Baseline and performance period models shall be fit using a least-squares regression method. The model must meet the following acceptance criteria, as required by the CPUC:  •   The net mean bias error (NMBE) must be greater than -0.5% and less than 0.5%. NMBE is calculated using Equation 1.  Equation 1.   𝑁𝑀𝐵𝐸 =  1  𝑛   ∑   (𝐸 𝑖 −𝐸̂ 𝑖 ) 𝑛  𝑖  𝐸 ̅ 𝑖  × 100  •   The coefficient of variation of the root mean square error CV(RSME) shall be less than or equal to 25%. CV(RMSE) is calculated using Equation 2.  Equation 2.   𝐶𝑉(𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸) =  ( ∑   ( 𝐸 𝑖 −𝐸̂ 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛  𝑖=1  (𝑛−𝑝)   )  1/2  𝐸̅  •   The Coefficient of Determination,   R 2 , should be checked to inform how well the dependent variable (temperature) explains the variation in the dependent variable (energy use), but it should not be used as an acceptance criterion. 1 0  Equation 3.   𝑅 2   = 1 −  1  𝑛   ∑   (𝐸 𝑖 −𝐸̂ 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛  𝑖  𝜎 𝐸  2  •   Savings Uncertainty for models with autocorrelation (models based on hourly and daily data) should be less than 50% at the 90% confidence level. The calculation should be made using the total expected savings from the feasibility study, or by assuming a minimum 10% savings would be achieved. Savings Uncertainty is expressed as a fraction of actual savings using the\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  14  formulation in Equation 4 14   from ASHRAE Guideline 14 for weather-dependent models with correlated residuals.

Plots of model residuals such as those shown in Figure 2 are useful for this purpose. Unacceptable amounts of these effects shall be removed from the model.  Figure 2. Residual Frequency and Scatter Plots  Should the fitted model fail to meet the goodness of fit criteria, additional independent variables representing other key drivers of energy usage in the building may be added to improve model fit, or the modeling strategy may be adapted to model different operation modes separately. If the revised model fails to meet the GOF criteria, alternative modeling algorithms may be used. If all attempts fail, the energy commodity (electricity or natural gas) or the entire project may be excluded from participation in the NMEC program offering.  3.5. Assessing Predictability  Assessing the predictability of a building’s energy use simply means determining whether an energy model that meets the required goodness-of-fit criteria may be developed from the energy use and independent variable data. A 12-month period of energy use and independent variable data is required. The data is collected and prepared, though not necessarily as rigorously as it would be for documenting in the M&V Plan as this is just a pre-screening exercise. A modeling algorithm and strategy are selected, a model developed, and the goodness of fit metrics are calculated. While pre-screening buildings, actual\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  16  savings estimates may not yet be available. In such cases a 10% savings over baseline year may be assumed to estimate the savings uncertainty.  Unusual energy use patterns occurring in the data may indicate the presence of an NRE. Information to explain what happened in the building during these unusual energy performance periods should be collected from the participant. This helps the assessment of how identified NREs will be treated throughout the project. There are various methods that may be used, as documented in Section 3.10.  A predictability report template is provided in Appendix 2.  3.6. Normalized Energy Savings  In PG&E’s NMEC programs, savings are determined under normalized conditions, which is defined by CALEE 2018 typical weather year data for the climate zone the building is located in. These weather files were updated in 2018 and may be found at   www.calmac.org/weather.asp . Normalized savings are the  difference between the baseline period energy use and the performance period energy use after they have been normalized to the CALEE 2018 weather conditions.  Normalized savings are reported after 12-months of reporting period data have been collected. A model based on performance period data must be developed so that performance period energy use under normalized conditions may be determined. Performance period models should use the same modeling algorithm and strategies as were used for the baseline model development.  All data and analysis activities must be reported in a savings report. A savings report template may be found in Appendix 5.  3.7 Avoided Energy Use  Avoided energy use is determined by inputting the performance period temperatures (and other independent variable values, if used) into the baseline energy model. This produces the adjusted baseline energy use. The avoided energy use is the sum of the adjusted baseline predictions less the sum of the performance period energy use to that point in time. Results may be tabulated or charted with time series charts of the adjusted baseline and performance period usage data, or with a cumulative sum of savings chart.  Various factors dictate how often if at all a savings progress report should be made. While savings progress analysis and reporting should not take long, if the project is not expected to produce large savings, only one progress report may be provided. If the project is large or there is a significant potential for NREs occurring, more frequent progress reports should be provided. The M&V Plan should document how often savings progress reports must be provided.  For projects anticipated to receive over $50,000 in incentives based on annual normalized savings, a savings progress report based on the avoided energy use achieved at 3 months is required.  A savings progress report template is provided in Appendix 4.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  17  3.8. Demand Savings  Demand savings will be determined by the DEER Peak Permanent Peak Demand Reduction calculation procedure, as documented in the 2021 IOU Statewide Customized Offering Procedures Manual for Business. 15   This procedure determines the average peak demand reduction from 4pm to 9pm over the three DEER peak period days defined for each climate zone. This calculation procedure may be completed with hourly baseline and performance period models. The models must meet the NMEC goodness of fit requirements, which include the CV(RMSE) and NMBE metrics described earlier. The savings uncertainty formula from ASHRAE is unreliable for models based on hourly data and should not be used. This is due to severe autocorrelation in the data.  When hourly models fail the goodness of fit criteria, alternate calculations, such as engineering calculations of the individual energy and demand savings of individual EEMs may be used, subject to the requirement that they are thoroughly documented in the savings report, and the data and live calculations are provided.  3.9. Approach to Ensure Adequate Monitoring in Reporting Period  Each M&V Plan is required to describe how often energy use and independent variable data in the performance period will be collected and avoided energy use calculated. This activity is critical for three reasons:  1.   To assure a participant’s sub meters continue to record data as expected. This is important for projects where a participant’s own energy metering systems are used. It is sometimes the case that these systems fail or encounter issues with data collection and archiving.  2.   To assure savings are accumulating as expected, and  3.   To periodically check for the presence of NREs, work with participants to determine their cause, and determine how to remove their impacts from the final savings analysis.  For each project, these factors are considered when determining the frequency of the savings progress reports. For example, projects with predictable buildings using reliable utility meter data may require savings progress to be checked only once or twice in the performance period. Projects with customer- owned meters, potential NREs, and uncertain upfront savings estimates may need to check savings progress each month.  Monitoring shall include the collection of data for each dependent variable (energy use in kWh, therms, chilled and hot water BTUs, etc.) and independent variable (weather data, production rates, etc.) used in the baseline model. Implementers must request the data from the utility or the participant according to a schedule developed in the project-level M&V Plan.  15   https://www.pge.com/pge_global/common/pdfs/save-energy-money/facility-improvements/custom-  retrofit/Statewide-Customized-Offering-Procedures-Manual-for-Business-2021.pdf\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  18  3.10. Identifying, Documenting and Adjusting for Non-Routine Events  Non-routine events are significant changes to the building or its operations that are unrelated to the EEMs. They can be short term, long term, or permanent changes in building energy use. They may be additions or removal of constant or variable loads. The IPMVP defines NREs as changes to a building’s prevailing conditions, or static factors. These conditions may be building and equipment operating conditions, added or removed energy consuming (or generating) equipment, reduced occupancy, major building additions or renovations. Major occupancy changes, HVAC equipment maintenance, and addition of new equipment are typical examples of NREs. Useful methods such as those described in the IPMVP Application Guide on Non-Routine Events & Adjustments 8F  16   may be used to address NREs in NMEC projects.  Using various techniques, NREs occurring in the baseline period may be accounted for when developing the baseline model. Because they may occur at any time without the participant’s or implementer’s knowledge, NREs occurring in the post-installation period present risks to the final savings estimation, and if not sufficiently documented will bias the energy savings calculation.  The project-level M&V plan should describe any NREs that occurred in the baseline period along with how they were treated, and any NREs anticipated during the performance period. Information on anticipated performance period NREs should be based on discussions with a knowledgeable representative of the participant, including type of NRE, its significance, anticipated time of occurrence, and duration. The project-level M&V Plan should describe how the NRE impacts will be quantified. The possibility of adding meters to help quantify NRE impacts should be considered.  During the performance period, the most common method to identify NREs is through visual inspection of the metered energy use data. Time-series charts of energy use data may be used to identify shifts in energy use patterns that may be caused by NREs. When a significant amount of performance period energy use data is available, an energy model may be developed. When the energy use data begins trending significantly outside expected values as determined by the model, an NRE may be present. Many other NRE detection algorithms may be used, as documented in the NRE Application Guide described above. Other methods that may be employed are provided by BPA 17   and LBNL. 18   NRE detection and impact quantification algorithms are the subject of ongoing research.  Each NRE and adjustment method should be described in the Energy Savings Reports.  16   IPMVP Application Guide on Non-Routine Events & Adjustments, October 2020, available from  www.evo-world.org .  17   SBW Consulting, April 30, 2018, Potential Analytics for Non-Routine Adjustments. Prepared for Bonneville Power Administration  18   https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/nre\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  19  Accounting for Savings from Non-Program EEMs  To the extent possible, customers should be discouraged from implementing EEMs incented under other programs, ineligible EEMS (such as purely normal replacement measures), or other changes to the building that affect its energy use for the duration of participation in PG&E’s Site-Level NMEC programs: Commercial Whole Building or Public Sector. In the event that such EEMs are installed, their impacts must be removed from the normalized savings analysis in a similar way as described above for non- routine adjustments. At a minimum, their installation start and completion dates must be identified, and the method used to remove their impacts from the normalized savings must be described in the savings reports. The reports must provide the data and the analysis files used to adjust the normalized savings.  Addressing COVID Impacts  Literature has recently emerged to describe methodologies to assess the low-occupancy impacts on energy use and savings in meter-based projects due to the shutdown caused by the COVID pandemic. 19  Many of the methods describe applications of techniques in the IPMVP NRE Application Guide. Following are short descriptions of methods implementers may use to assess the low occupancy impacts and account for them in baseline models and the savings analysis. These descriptions are not comprehensive. More appropriate and applicable methods that address each project’s circumstances may be found in the IPMVP NRE Application Guide.  Assessing Low-Occupancy Impacts  Not all buildings are affected the same way. The deepest reductions in energy use are evident in commercial office buildings and hotels, while hospitals and grocery stores continue to operate normally or have increased use. One method to assess the impacts of the low-occupancy period is to collect energy and independent variable data (usually temperature) for the calendar years of 2019 and 2020. Develop a regression model based on the 2019 data and use the 2020 independent variable data to determine the predictions from the 2019 model in 2020. Assuming there were no other changes to the building in 2020, the difference between the predictions and the actual data provide an indication of the impact of the pandemic on energy use in 2020.  Baseline Models with Occupancy Data  For projects with baseline periods that include 2020 and the low-occupancy periods, if possible, identify a source of data that may serve as a proxy to occupancy. Such sources may include key card swipes tracked by the security system, connections to building IT networks, air handler fan motor variable speed drive speed signals, or other sources. The data must have the same time interval of analysis as the energy use data. It should have a significant amount of variance throughout the baseline period corresponding to the shutdown period, as it will be tested for significance in explaining the energy use. The data source must be available throughout the baseline and performance periods. If the proxy  19   See EVO’s M&V Focus magazine, March 2021 for three related articles:   https://evo-world.org/en/news-  media/m-v-focus/884-m-v-focus-march-2021-issue-8 .\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  20  occupancy variable is significant, the model will account for the impact of occupancy automatically and provide reliable estimates of savings.  Baseline Models without Occupancy Data  For projects where a source of occupancy data cannot be found, consider recommending establishing an occupancy data source for the performance period, establishing a m a xi mum correction factor based on the assessment described above, and using the proxy variable to diminish the correction factor throughout the performance period as the building increases occupancy. Savings would be based on a model developed from data from the pre-COVID shutdown period. Its predictions would be adjusted by a correction factor that is adjusted from its ma xi mum value as the building re-occupies. This correction factor adjustment would be based on the new occupancy variable.  In each case, the M&V plan and savings report must provide a description of why the occupancy variable was selected, its data source and reliability, and its significance in the energy models.  3.11. Determining Project Influence  Project influence documentation should be consistent with other custom program requirements, which are described below.  A narrative and supporting evidence must be provided to document the actions performed by the program that induced the customer to implement the energy efficiency project. The narrative should include the project developer's engagement and communications with the customer, the customer's decision-making criteria, and the project timeline, and should describe how the project was initiated, how the measure was identified, the alternative viable options that also meet the customer's needs, and the energy and non- energy benefits. Supporting evidence with time stamps must be provided to support the narrative. The supporting evidence may include one or more of the following:  •   Marketing materials, including website links, or other communication about program details. Marketing materials provide program details and allow program staff to intervene and upsell EE measures.  •   Audits or site visit results where EE opportunities are assessed. Site visits can illuminate additional EE opportunities and validate/quantify known opportunities.  •   Energy savings and/or financial calculations for EE measures. Showing the value of EE savings and effects of incentives can motivate a customer to pursue a project they otherwise would not have in absence of program intervention.  •   Email correspondence or meeting minutes with timestamps that discuss any of the above or that support the narrative.  •   Customer decision-making policies such as corporate sustainability policy or investment criteria.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  21  •   Internal customer communications or communications with design team that discuss design alternatives, cost estimates, or the customer’s decision making process.  Effective Date: Program inception  Rule Source: R.09-11-014 EE Policy Manual v5  The Public Sector and CWB offerings will apply the net-to-gross (NTG) ratio of 0.95 per CPUC Resolution E-4952.  3.12. Rationale for Confidence in Savings when Less than 10% of Baseline Consumption  Predictability analysis will assess the project’s ability to detect a minimum 10% savings based on ASHRAE’s fractional savings uncertainty formula, provided in Section 3.4. This formulation uses the baseline model MSE, the savings expressed as a fraction of baseline energy use (assumed to be 10%), the t-statistic for a confidence level of 90% (1.65), and the number of points in the baseline and performance periods respectively. An adjustment to the number of points n is made for lag-1 autocorrelation, n’, when modeling with hourly or daily time interval data.  After measures have been identified and their expected savings quantified, the uncertainty for the expected savings may be determined using the same formula.  To be detectable, the ma xi mum allowable savings cannot be more than 50% at the 90% confidence level.  Use of interval data and advanced modeling methods means that even if fewer EEMs are installed or if they are not functioning as intended, savings down to levels of 4 – 5 % may still be determined with reasonable accuracy and confidence.  3.13. Documentation of Costs, Energy Savings, and Expected Useful Life  Each site-level NMEC project requires a list of EEMs with their estimated savings, measure costs, and EUL. This is for the purposes of informing the participant of the costs and benefits of different EEM options. The customer selects the measures from this list, with the requirement to achieve 10% of baseline use or more in savings after implementation. Because all savings are quantified from the   e xi sting conditions baseline, the individual EEM savings estimates need not quantify to-standard practice and above-code portions of savings. Deemed savings estimates for specific EEMs may be used if their gross savings from   e xi sting conditions baselines are available. For each EEM, its full measure cost must be estimated and its EUL must be determined. A weighted average EUL for the entire list of recommended EEMs must be determined. The weighted average EUL is calculated by adding together the product of each EEM’s EUL multiplied by its expected savings and dividing by the total expected savings. This information must be documented in the feasibility study report.  After the implementation period, a list of installed EEMs with their expected savings, costs, and EULs will be documented. This may be a shorter list than that documented in the feasibility study. Individual EEM savings estimates must be updated if the EEMs were not installed as assumed in the original savings\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  22  estimations, and a new weighted EUL calculated. At the end of the twelve-month performance period, the final savings will be apportioned to each individual EEM, and a final weighted average EUL determined.  3.14. Project Level EUL Calculation  A weighted average EUL will be estimated for each installed and verified measure based on the measure’s original expected savings estimate and the measure’s EUL as determined above. The weighted average for all recommended EEMs will be reported in the feasibility study report, and the updated weighted average EUL for the EEMs actually installed and verified will be included in the post- installation report.  3.15. Accounting for On-Site Generation or Other Fuel Sources  Energy savings claims should only support impacts to energy supplied by PG&E. If a facility generates electricity and exports it to the grid, then the energy savings must be limited to the amount delivered from the grid for each hour of each day in the reporting period. On-site generation may include solar photovoltaic panels and other renewable energy sources, cogeneration equipment, or other equipment.  NMEC projects at customer sites must include a description of the non-IOU fuel source, data collected and analyzed, and how savings will be capped to limit savings to the amount of delivered energy from the grid, according to the governing non-IOU policy. 20  3.16. Case When One Energy Model Fails Acceptance Criteria  Some projects pursuing site-level NMEC may encounter a situation where one energy use model (usually electricity) passes while another energy use model (usually natural gas) fails the model acceptance criteria. In these cases, additional effort should be made to enable the energy model to pass. Recommendations to improve the model include:  1.   Extending the baseline data from 12 months (program minimum requirement) to 24 months,  2.   Developing weekly/monthly models instead of daily,  3.   Using a different modeling algorithm,  4.   Adding additional independent variables, such as occupancy loads.  20   Energy Efficiency Savings Eligibility at Sites with non-IOU Supplied Energy Sources – Guidance document. Version 1.1.  file:///K:/Jobs/PG&E/2018%20TechAssist%20for%20Eval%20of%20NMEC/2.%20Regulatory%20Support  /M&V%20Plan%20and%20Prog%20Man%202021/Savings%20at%20Sites%20with%20non-  IOU%20Fuel%20Sources%20-%20Guidance%20Doc.pdf\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  23  If none of these options yields a model that meets the goodness of fit criteria, then the measures providing direct savings (see Definitions) for the energy use with the failed models may be incented under the Custom project ruleset.  3.17. Negative Savings  As described in the California Energy Efficiency Policy Manual Version 6 (April 2020), 21   projects resulting in negative savings will be claimed by PG&E, but Customers are not penalized for negative indirect savings. However negative direct savings are accounted for and reduce the incentive.  Clearly, negative direct savings results should be avoided by assuring that the EEM will result in lowered energy use. In situations where all EEMs save electricity, but may result in negative indirect natural gas savings, the negative indirect savings must be reported.  4.   Definitions  Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI): An integrated system of smart meters (AMI meters),  communication networks, and data management systems that enables two-way communication between utilities and customers. Among other capabilities, AMI meters enable measurement of energy use in short time intervals, such as 15 minutes, hourly, or daily, providing better insights into building operations, compared to monthly billing data.  AMI Data: Data produced by AMI meters.  Autocorrelation: Also known as serial correlation; the correlation between the elements of a series and  others from the same series separated from them by a given interval. Error terms that are correlated over time are said to be autocorrelated. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.  Avoided Energy Use: Reduction in energy use or demand that occurs in the reporting period, relative to  the baseline period, as adjusted by routine and non-routine adjustments, for the reporting period conditions.  Baseline Training Period: Period of time chosen to represent the operation of the facility before the  implementation of an energy efficiency measure.  Categorical Variable: Variables used in empirical modeling that have discrete values and are not  continuous. They may represent different operation periods in a building, such as occupied and non- occupied periods.  Coefficient of Determination   R 2 : The coefficient of determination ( R^ 2 ) is the measure of how well future  outcomes are likely to be predicted by the model. It illustrates how well the independent variables explain  21   https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/energyefficiency/\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  24  variation in the dependent variable.   R^ 2   values range from 0 (indicating none of the variation in the dependent variable is associated with variation in any of the independent variables) to 1 (indicating all of the variation in the dependent variable is associated with variation in the independent variables, a “perfect fit” of the regression model to the data).  Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Squared Error CV(RMSE): The coefficient of variation of the  root mean squared error (CV(RMSE) is the RMSE expressed as a fraction or percentage of the mean of the actual data.  CZ2020 Weather Data: CZ2010 Weather Data is long term average weather data published by the  California Energy Commission.  Dependent Variable: A variable whose value depends on values of one or more other variables. In this  document, the dependent variable is the energy use measured at the energy meter, such as electric, natural gas, chilled or hot water, and steam.  Direct Savings: Direct energy savings occur as the primary source of the EEM, for example the lower  energy a newly installed lighting fixture uses over that from the inefficient lighting fixture it replaced represents direct energy savings. See also Indirect Savings.  Feasibility Study: A document that includes a description of the building, its equipment, and operations,  annual energy use, recommended EEMS with individual energy (kWh and therms) and demand savings information, costs and cost-effectiveness metrics for each measure, individual measure estimated useful life (EUL) and weighted EUL calculations, documentation of program influence, and the project M&V Plan. Additional relevant information as described in this document should also be included.  Implementer. An Implementer is an entity that has technical expertise in building energy systems,  conducting energy audits and recommending efficiency measures, verifying savings, and related reporting. Implementers may include trade professionals, engineering service providers, or customers themselves.  Independent Variable: A parameter that is expected to change regularly and has a measurable effect on  the energy use of a building. Independent variables may be continuously changing, such as ambient dry- bulb temperature, humidity, and production rate, or may represent operation modes of a building (categorical), such as occupied and unoccupied periods, school in-session or out-of-session periods, etc.  Indirect Savings: Indirect energy savings or savings from interactive effects are savings that occur from  other than the primary purpose of the EEM. For example, a lighting retrofit lowers the energy use of the replaced fixtures and lowers the energy required for cooling in the building. The lowered energy of the cooling system is indirect energy savings or savings from interactive effects.  M&V: Measurement and Verification (M&V) is the process of using measurement to reliably determine  actual savings created within an individual facility by an energy efficiency intervention. Savings cannot be directly measured, since they represent the absence of energy use. Instead, savings are determined by comparing measured use before and after implementation of a project, making appropriate adjustments for changes in conditions.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  25  M&V Plan: The project-level M&V plan is a document describing the energy efficiency measures, data  collection activities, data analysis methods and reporting activities for a prospective NMEC project. The preparation of a project-level M&V Plan is a required part of project approval. Advance planning ensures that all data needed for savings determination will be available after implementation of the energy efficiency measures.  Non-Routine Event: Changes that occur in a building that are not related to energy efficiency measures,  but that affect the energy use in the baseline and/or the reporting period, that must be accounted for in savings estimations.  Normalized Mean Bias Error NMBE. NMBE refers to normalized mean bias error, which is the total error  in the model expressed as a fraction of the total energy use, adjusted for the number of parameters in the model.  Normalized Metered Energy Consumption (NMEC): Energy use in a baseline and/or a reporting period is  adjusted to a common, or normal, set of conditions. Savings based on NMEC is what the savings would be under a normal set of conditions, which usually includes long-term average weather for building climate zones.  Normalized Savings: Reduction in energy consumption or demand that occurs in the reporting period,  relative to the baseline period, after both have been adjusted to a common set of conditions.  Performance Period: Period of time chosen for the purposes of verifying savings after implementation of  energy efficiency measures (also known as reporting period).  Project Measurement Boundary: The Project Measurement Boundary refers to the portion of the building  or facility included in the energy savings model. In the context of Option C (whole building) analysis, the measurement boundary encompasses the whole facility. For M&V plans that utilize submetering, or selection of a subset of meters serving the building, the project measurement boundary is the portion of the building served by the selected meters or submeters.  Residual: The residual is the difference between the predicted and actual value of the dependent variable  in an energy consumption model.  Static Factors: The energy-governing factors that are not usually expected to change (e.g., facility size,  design and operation of installed equipment, number of weekly production shifts, or type or number of occupants). The associated static factors must be monitored for change throughout the reporting period.  Weather Coverage Factor: Weather coverage factor may be expressed as the range of weather  parameter (e.g. dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, etc.) extended by at most 10% that includes (or ‘covers’) the range of weather data used to normalize the baseline or post-installation energy use. It may also be expressed as the amount of time represented by the normal conditions data that is covered by the extended range of the training period weather data. Modeling best practices require that an empirical model not be used to extrapolate far beyond the range of data from which it was developed.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  26  Appendix 1: Description of the LBNL Temperature and Time-of-Week Modeling Algorithm  The following description includes descriptions of the time-of-week model and temperature (TOWT model) adapted from its original authors, along with descriptions of adaptations that have been added to improve model fit. For a more comprehensive description of the original modeling algorithm, please consult the publication by Matthieu, et. al. 22  •   A building’s energy use (natural gas use, hot water, steam, or chilled water, as well as electricity) is generally a function of ambient temperature and the time of week. In some cases, additional parameters influence energy use in buildings, such as humidity and a production variable. The TOWT model may include independent variables in addition to the time-of-week and temperature, if their data are provided in concurrent time intervals (such as hourly or daily time intervals). As the dominant influencing parameters for building energy use is the schedule of operation and ambient temperature, this model description focuses on the use of these parameters. The following discussion uses electric kWh as the energy data, however it applies equally well for other energy sources.  •   The time-of-week parameter is modeled as an indicator variable. This allows some flexibility to define this parameter according to the time-interval of the data. Electric energy use data (kWh) from advanced metering systems is typically available in 15-minute intervals, ambient temperature data from weather stations are typically available in hourly intervals. Natural gas energy use data (therms) from advanced metering systems is also available in hourly or daily time intervals. The following description assumes hourly time intervals, but also applies for daily time intervals.  •   Each week is divided into hourly intervals (indexed by i), with the first interval from midnight to 1 am Monday morning, the second from 1 am to 2 am, and so on for the 168 hours each week (7 for daily time intervals). A different regression coefficient for each time of week indicator variable,    i , allows each time-of-week to have a different predicted load.  •   Energy response to temperature in a building is non-linear but may be modeled as continuous and piecewise linear. At low temperatures, electric energy use may increase as temperatures lower due to more use of heating system equipment such as pumps, fans, and electric heating elements. In moderate temperatures, the building does not require heating and cooling and therefore energy use is not sensitive to temperature. At warm temperatures, energy use increases with increasing temperature due to use of cooling system equipment. At the highest temperatures, energy use may again be insensitive to temperature as cooling equipment has reached its maximum load. There may be multiple regimes of energy response to temperature.  22   Matthieu, J.L., P.N. Price, S. Kiliccote, and M.A. Piette, “Quantifying Changes in Building Electricity Use, With Application to Demand Response,” IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 2:507-518, 2011.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  27  •   For natural gas use in multi-family buildings, we expect high gas use at low ambient temperatures, with use decreasing as temperature warm. At some point, space heating is no longer required, and the only use for gas is for water heating, which is expected to have a milder relationship with ambient temperature. We therefore also expect multiple regimes for natural gas use, though they are likely fewer than for electric use.  •   Boundary temperature values of the piecewise linear temperature segments may be chosen in two ways:  •   Specified by the user  •   Specified to have equal length line segments  •   Specified to have an equal number of data points to define each line segment.  Boundary temperature values specified by the user is appropriate when the energy use behavior is known in the different temperature regimes. Some care should be taken to assure there are a significant number of data points that define the line segments at the high and low ends of the range. When the temperature response of the building is unknown, a good practice is to define the line segments throughout the temperature range by specifying that each line segment shall have the same number of points. This assures that the highest and lowest line segments are well-defined and avoids potential extrapolation errors when making model predictions for temperature conditions outside the range used to develop the model.  •   The piecewise linear and continuous temperature at time   t ,   T(t i )   (which occurs at time of week interval  i ) is broken down into a number of component temperatures,   T c.j (t i ) , with   j   = 1 to   n s   ( n s   being the number of line segments, usually no more than 10 to avoid overfitting, often 6 is enough). Each   T c.j (t i )  is multiplied by   j   and then summed to determine the temperature dependent load. Boundary temperature values of the temperature segments are defined by   B k   ( k   = 1… n s -1). And component temperatures are determined with the following algorithm (assuming   n s   = 6):  o   If   T ( t i ) >   B 1 , then   T c,1 ( t i ) =   B 1 . Otherwise,   T c,1 ( t i ) =   T ( t i )   and   T c,m ( t i ) = 0   for   m   = 2 … 6 and algorithm is ended.  o   For   n   = 2 … 4, if   T ( t i ) >   B n , then   T c,n ( t i ) =   B n   –   B n-1 . Otherwise,   T c,n ( t i ) =   T ( t i ) –   B n-1   and   T c,m ( t i ) = 0 f or   m   = ( n   + 1) … 6 and algorithm is ended.  o   If   T ( t i ) >   B 5 , then   T c,5 ( t i ) =   B 5   –   B 4   and   T c,6 ( t i ) =   T ( t i ) –   B 5 .  For example, if the boundary temperatures were specified as   B 1   = 30,   B 2   = 40,   B 3   = 50,   B 4   = 60, and  B 5   = 70 °F, the temperatures   T   would be sorted into the   T c,i (t i )   matrix as shown Figure A-1 below.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  28  T   T c,1   T c,2   T c,3   T c,4   T c,5   T c,6  28   28   0   0   0   0   0  35   30   5   0   0   0   0  56   30   10   10   6   0   0  64   30   10   10   10   4   0  72   30   10   10   10   10   2  Figure A-1. Example component temperature computation.  •   The building is anticipated to have a different response to temperature in occupied periods versus unoccupied periods. The TOWT algorithm uses a very simple method to separate occupied from unoccupied time periods. It develops a simple linear regression with all the baseline energy and temperature data to determine occupied versus unoccupied time periods. It defines occupied times as those times of week where the differences between the data and simple linear model prediction are positive 65% of the time or more. For hourly data, unoccupied periods tend to be nights, weekends, and holidays. For daily data, unoccupied periods tend to be weekends and holidays.  •   The occupied load is expected to have a time component, a temperature component ( T ), and potential dependence on other independent variables ( OV ). It is estimated using the following equation:  𝐸̂ 𝑜,𝑏 (𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑇(𝑡 𝑖 ), 𝑂𝑉(𝑡 𝑖 )) = 𝛼 𝑖   + ∑ 𝛽 𝑗 𝑇 𝑐,𝑗 (𝑡 𝑖 )  𝑛 𝑠  𝑗=1  + ∑ 𝛾 𝑘 𝑂𝑉(𝑡 𝑖 )  𝑛 𝑂𝑉  𝑘=1  Where   𝐸̂ 𝑜,𝑏   is the predicted occupied energy use in the baseline period. A similar expression is used for the performance period model occupied period.  •   Unoccupied loads are expected to have similar dependence as occupied loads, but potentially less dependence on temperature, since the building is expected to operate without sensitivity to temperature when systems are off during these periods. Unoccupied load is modeled with the following equation:  𝐸̂ 𝑢,𝑏 (𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑇(𝑡 𝑖 ), 𝑂𝑉(𝑡 𝑖 )) = 𝛿 𝑖   + ∑ 𝜃 𝑗 𝑇 𝑐,𝑗 (𝑡 𝑖 )  𝑚 𝑠  𝑗=1  + ∑ 𝜇 𝑘 𝑂𝑉(𝑡 𝑖 )  𝑚 𝑂𝑉  𝑘=1  Where   𝐸̂ 𝑢,𝑏   is the predicted unoccupied energy use in the baseline period. A similar expression is used for the performance period model unoccupied period.  •   The parameters   i , for   i   = 1 to 168,   j   for   j   = 1 to   𝑛 𝑠   line segments, and   𝛾 𝑘   for the number of independent variables   𝑛 𝑂𝑉   , are estimated using the data from the occupied period with ordinary least squares regression. The parameters   𝛿 𝑖   for   i   = 1 to 168,   𝜃 𝑗   for   j   = 1 to   𝑚 𝑠   line segments, and   𝜇 𝑘   for the\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  29  number of independent variables   𝑚 𝑂𝑉   , are estimated using the data from the unoccupied period with ordinary least squares regression.  •   Based on discussions with one of the TOWT algorithm’s authors, 23   additional independent variables may be added to a TOWT model as it is fundamentally an ordinary least squares regression. Other independent variables may be continuous, such as a production rate, or categorical, such as a school operating schedule. Each additional independent variable should be significant, as demonstrated by its p-value or t-statistic. Note that additional independent variables are not included in LBNL’s RMV2.0 R code.  •   The total energy use estimated by the model is the sum of the occupied and unoccupied terms for each time interval.  𝐸̂ 𝑏   = ∑(𝐸̂ 𝑜,𝑏   + 𝐸̂ 𝑢,𝑏 )  𝑛 𝑖=1  •   The model produces residuals that are autocorrelated and heteroscedastic, and the regression parameters   i   and   j , and   i   and   j   are correlated. This means that the standard errors associated with each regression parameter underestimates their level of uncertainty. However, uncertainty on the load predictions can be approximated with the standard error, which can be computed at each interval   i .  •   There are multiple tools that implement the TOWT algorithm, although there are differences among them.  o   LBNL’s RMV2.0 is open source public domain R code available from LBNL’s GitHub public repository RMV2.0. It is part of an R code package that develops baseline models and calculates avoided energy use (given the required baseline and performance period data). It does not have inputs for additional independent variables, however they may be included through additional programming. RMV2.0 was originally developed to estimate demand savings for demand response events. It includes a weighting function that weights the most recent data points in the model in order to improves its predictions during demand response events.  o   kW Engineering’s nmecr is open source public domain R code available from kW Engineering’s GitHub public repository nmecr. It’s TOWT algorithm was developed from RMV2.0, however the weighting function was made optional. It is an R code package that develops baseline and post-installation models, calculates avoided energy use and normalized savings, outputs goodness of fit metrics, model and savings uncertainties based on ASHRAE Guideline 14 formulations, and independent variable coefficients and statistics, and includes other independent variables. It includes vignettes in the R markdown, pdf, and .docx formats. It provides a code base with version control and invites collaborators to add  23   Phillip Price Ph.D.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  30  functionality, such as improved uncertainty calculations and quantification of non-routine event impacts.  o   Universal Translator version 3 (UT3) M&V Analysis module. Funded under the California Energy Commission’s Public Interest Energy Research program and completed in 2014, this analysis module in PG&E’s free UT3 desktop software enables users to manually upload data, develop baseline and performance period energy models, and calculate avoided energy use and normalized savings. It has many features that allow users fl e xi bility in modeling approaches in order to develop the best fitting baseline and performance period energy models.

Using empirical models, 24   a building is considered predictable if:  •   a model can be developed that meets certain goodness of fit and accuracy metrics as defined in this report, and  24   Empirical models are simple linear regression or more advanced models, not building simulation models.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  32  •   the risk of non-routine events is limited or non-existent. 25  The purpose of this report is to document the findings of the predictability analysis of the project as a criterion for participation in the PG&E Commercial Whole Building Program. This report documents the energy and weather data received, summary descriptions of the models developed, and provides a summary table of the key model goodness of fit and accuracy metrics for each model.  We received data for two energy use commodities: electricity and natural gas. This data was provided by   _____ . The data were in   ___   time intervals, the energy unit for each commodity was  __ _ , and the data spanned the time period from MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm through MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm   –   a full year.  For each meter, we developed an energy model based on daily data. Below, we summarize the data received, the modeling algorithms used, and the results of the predictability analysis.  25   Non-routine events (NREs) are changes to building energy use due to changes in occupancy, additions of loads, equipment maintenance periods, and so on. Significant changes to building energy use not caused by installed measures are considered to be caused by NREs.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  33  Electricity  Summary of Data Received  Energy Data   Weather Data  Utility   Data from   ___   Weather Station   (list location)  Commodity   Electricity   Approx.

The cause of these changes in energy use should be investigated. Understanding their cause will help identify it as a non-routine event, improve the model fit, and determine how to address them when estimating savings.  The time-series chart of temperature, energy use, and modeled energy use data below show the energy use patterns over the model training period (separate charts for electricity and natural gas).\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  36  Goodness of Fit Metrics  Coefficient of Variation of the root mean squared error,   𝐶𝑉(𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸) =  ( ∑   (𝐸 𝑖 − 𝐸 ̂   𝑖 ) 2 𝑛  𝑖=1  ( 𝑛−𝑝)   )  1/2  𝐸̅  CV(RMSE) is a measure of how much random error there is between a model’s predictions and  the dependent variable data it is based on. Generally, we want to minimize this error as much as possible.  Net Determination Bias Error,   𝑁𝐷𝐵𝐸 = ∑   ( 𝐸 𝑖   −   𝐸̂ 𝑖 ) 𝑛 𝑖=1   𝐸 ⁄  NDBE is a measure of how the model’s predictions of training period total energy use is  different than the actual energy use. this error should be very very low.  Coefficient of Determination,   𝑅 2   = 1 −  1  𝑛   ∑   (𝐸 𝑖 −𝐸̂ 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛  𝑖  𝜎 𝐸  2  The coefficient of determination describes how well the independent variable explains the variations in the dependent (energy) variable. Higher   R 2   means the independent variables have more explanatory power. This is an informative metric only, not a criterion, because while the  energy use may not have high variation, an independent variable may adequately ‘explain’ the  e xi sting variation in the energy use, despite a low   R 2 .  Mean Bias Error,   𝑀𝐵𝐸 = ∑   ( 𝐸 𝑖   −   𝐸̂ 𝑖 )/𝑛 𝑛 𝑖=1  The MBE is a similar metric to the NDBE but has units of energy.  ASHRAE Guideline 14- 2002 provided these formulas to determine the ‘fractional savings uncertainty’ as a  means to estimate the uncertainty of the savings estimated with this modeling approach. The formulation also enables one to estimate how well we will know savings based only on the baseline  model’s goodness of fit metric CV(RMSE), the number of points in the basel ine and post-installation period, the amount of savings, the level of confidence at which we estimate the uncertainty and including a correction for autocorrelation. Using this formula, we can estimate what the savings uncertainty would be to achieve 10% savings, at 90% confidence, for a year of post-installation period monitoring, for a baseline model with a year of data and its CV(RMSE) value. We want the uncertainty to be low, but the minimum level of uncertainty cannot be greater than ± 50% at the 90% confidence level. Note the percentage refers to the amount of savings, not to the baseline energy use.  Additional research by LBNL showed that ASHRAE’s formula for uncertainty was invalid when used on  hourly models, due to the high degree of autocorrelation in the data.

The M&V plan presented here adheres to the PG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC manual. This approach is consistent with the requirements set forth by the AB 802 legislation and the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) NMEC Rulebook 2.0.  Energy savings represent the absence of energy use and cannot be directly measured. M&V involves the process of using measurements to reliably quantify actual gross energy savings from an energy savings project within a facility, a process, a building, or a building subsystem. It is used to verify that an energy efficiency project is achieving its intended savings, using measurements of energy use before and after implementation of an energy or water savings project, with appropriate adjustments made for changes in conditions. Such adjustments may be routine and expected, while others are non-routine and due to factors unrelated to the project.  This M&V Plan describes the assessment of energy models to be used in the savings analysis. It describes the baseline and reporting periods, the data collection and analysis activities to be carried out throughout each period and describes how and when normalized savings will be reported for the (site or project name). This M&V plan describes the independent variables, the analysis time intervals, and the modeling algorithms that will be used to develop baseline and reporting period energy models. It describes how non-routine events will be identified and treated in the baseline, implementation, and reporting periods.  The M&V Plan is required prior to project installation to document and describe the approach to quantifying savings, the key measurements required and computation methods, the timing of these activities, roles and responsibilities of involved parties, and the quality assurance requirements associated with the process. The main body of this M&V Plan provides a narrative description of the process and requirements. Individual project information for is provided in an Attachment to this M&V Plan. The Attachment provides:  1.   The energy conservation measures and their expected savings  2.   Energy meter ID, the model training period, and annual energy use  3.   Independent variables used in the model training period and their data sources  4.   Non-routine events identified during the model training period, if any  5.

Terminology\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  43  Baseline Model:   A mathematical model, developed using empirical modeling methods (such as regression analysis), using energy use and independent variable data collected during the baseline period.  Adjusted Baseline Energy Use:   Energy use that would have occurred in the reporting period had no measures been installed. The adjusted baseline use is determined by inputting independent variable data collected during the reporting period into the baseline model.  Avoided Energy Use:   Reduction in energy use relative to the baseline period, as adjusted for the reporting period conditions. Avoided Energy Use is calculated as difference between the baseline energy use and the adjusted baseline energy use.  Model Training Period:   A period of time prior to the measure installation period that represents typical building energy use behavior. Its duration should be one year unless otherwise noted. The model training period is used to assess how accurately a baseline energy use model may be developed, and to observe the presence of any non-routine events. Baseline models are generally developed from a one-year period immediately prior to the start of the measure installation period but may be developed from the model training period data under certain circumstances.  Normal Conditions:   A non-extreme set of conditions that is representative of conditions typically expected for the building and its operations. Savings estimated under normal conditions are expected to represent typical savings for the project and are not over- or under-estimated due to extreme conditions that may occur in the given reporting period.  Normalized Savings:   Savings based on the overall reduction in normalized metered energy consumption. Savings from a project that are based on ‘normal conditions’ as agreed upon by project stakeholders. Normalized savings may require that both baseline and reporting period energy use be adjusted to a common set of normal conditions.  Non-Routine Event:   An event within the building, occurring outside of the project’s installed energy efficiency measures’ scope, that affects the energy use measured at the meter. Non-routine events may include equipment shut down for maintenance, added building load due to a data center, or sudden change in occupancy such as when building tenants move in or out.  Non-Routine Adjustment:   Adjustments to baseline energy use made necessary by the occurrence of non-routine events. Such adjustments are necessary so that the resulting computed normalized savings are due to the project’s installed energy efficiency measures, and not due to other events that affect the energy use at the meter.  Project Description  2.1 Site Description  -   Facility description  -   Description and summary of audit(s) or scoping site visit(s) including involved parties and date(s)\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  44  o   Can reference/attach external audit  2.2 Energy Efficiency Measures  A list of the proposed energy conservation measures with their individual savings estimates are provided in Attachment 1 of this M&V Plan. The measures were developed and documented in the project feasibility study.  Measurement and Verification Procedures  4.1. Verification of Measure Installation  Example text below.  (Customer name) will monitor each the project’s start and end of the measure installation period and notify PG&E so that the baseline period and the reporting period start and end dates may be specified. (customer name) will monitor the installation of energy conservation measures and verify that the measures are installed and operating correctly. It is recommended that (customer name) collect photos, make measurements, conduct functional testing or trend analysis of operational data (trended by the energy management system) to verify that the installed measures are performing as per expectation. (Customer name) will provide a post-installation report upon completion to PG&E. This report will include measure installation completion dates for use in the M&V analysis.  4.2. Measurement Boundary and Energy Meters  Measurement Boundary  All ECMs must be installed within the measurement boundary, which includes all the systems served by the (site or project name) electric utility meters.  Energy Meters  This project concerns electric and natural savings; therefore, data from the utility electric and natural gas energy meters will be used. The (site or project name)’s meters have been identified and documented in Attachment 1.  4.3. Baseline Model Development  Energy Use (Dependent) Variables  Describe the Energy (dependent variables) – example text provided below.  Electric and natural gas energy use (kWh) are the dependent variables and data from the (project name)’s meters will be used in the M&V analysis described herein. All energy use data has been inspected for missing or erroneous values (if any). Data preparation procedures for the project are described in Attachment 1. The energy use readings have been added up to daily time intervals. The selected modeling algorithm (described below) used daily time intervals. Figure 1 in Attachment 1 shows\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  45  the daily energy use along with the modeled energy use and daily average temperature the over the model training period.  Independent Variables  Describe the independent variable(s) – example text provided below.  Independent variables included ambient temperature, averaged to a daily time interval, and school operating schedule, as represented by indicator variables. Indicator variables are used to show holidays, in-session and out-of-session periods and are derived from information for individual schools. Weather data was obtained from (name of weather source). The weather data source, data period used, and other descriptive information for the temperature data are in the Attachment. The weather data received by (implementer, M&V analyst) were inspected and (description of issues found). Indicator variables for the school operating schedules can be found in Attachment 1.  Independent Variables Not Included in the Analysis  Example text below.  No other independent variables were considered in the analysis. Variables such as building occupancy may have had an impact on the energy use, but no data on the number of occupants were available.  Normalized Conditions  Per CPUC Policy, the normalized conditions are represented by the CALEE 2018 dataset for this location’s climate zone, which is Climate Zone X. The Attachment describes the Normalized Conditions weather file for this climate zone.  Model Training Period  Example text below.  The model training period represented one year of energy use data, as per NMEC requirements. Energy use models were developed using this data to assess whether an accurate baseline model could be developed and used for estimating savings with reasonable confidence. Note that the model training period does not necessarily represent the baseline period, as the baseline period may be updated based on the first measure installation date. A new baseline model may be developed for the Savings Reports for each school, should the installation period exceed 18 months, per CPUC requirement.  The Attachment describes the model training period used for assessing each model’s accuracy for the savings expected from each project.  Baseline Period Non-Routine Adjustments  Example text below.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  46  Non-routine events (NREs) are events that occur in buildings that affect energy use and are unrelated to the efficiency measures. Impacts of NREs must be accounted for in the baseline and reporting periods. The Attachment describes whether NREs were identified during the model training period and how they were treated for this project.  Modeling Algorithm  Example text below (for TOWT model). Note other models may be used.  The electric energy use was modeled using a variation of Lawrence Berkley National Lab’s (LBNL) time- of-week and temperature (TOWT) model in the R programming language. This modeling algorithm uses indicator variables for each time-of-week (168 for hourly, 7 for daily) to group together similar operating periods during each week. It also segments the range of temperatures into 6 lines, assuring the same number of points define each line segment. Because a building’s operating schedule and the ambient temperature are major drivers of energy use, the TOWT model was selected for this project.  The TOWT modeling algorithm allows additional independent variables to be used, including indicator variables. We’ve added indicator variables to define different operating modes for (the school).  The model’s algorithm was modified to ensure all datapoints are weighed equally in the analysis. The data was summed to a daily data interval to minimize variability within the data and achieve acceptable model goodness of fit criteria. Average daily temperature and indicator variables representing different operation periods were used as the independent variables. Charts of the daily metered and modeled energy use with daily average ambient temperatures for each school are provided in the Attachment.  Coverage Factors  Example text below.  Good modeling practice requires that models be developed from a dataset that includes the m a xi mum range of energy and independent variable values. In addition, good practice requires that models not be extrapolated more than 10% beyond the m a xi mum and minimum of the independent variable data in the training period. In this project, baseline energy use will be estimated under the normalized conditions defined by the California CALEE 2018 Climate Zone X weather data. The coverage factor shows how much of training period range of weather used on model development covers the range of the normalized conditions weather.  The NMEC program requires that a full year of baseline period data be used to develop the baseline model for both energy and demand savings (demand savings described below). The Attachment shows that the extended model training period, developed for the daily data interval, captures 100% of the temperatures of the normal conditions data set and 100% of the total days of the normalized conditions year. The extended model training period for the hourly model, captures 89.7% of the temperatures of the normal conditions data set and 99.8% of the total hours, leaving 18 hours outside this range. The hourly models will only be used for peak demand reduction estimation and since the peak hours, as defined by DEER, are within the normalized conditions data set already, the uncovered 18 hours are not expected to have any negative effects on the models’ prediction accuracy. The comparison of daily and hourly temperature distributions with normal conditions have been plotted in the Attachment.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  47  Baseline Model Accuracy Metrics  Example text below.  The acceptance criteria for the baseline models’ accuracy metrics are:  1.   CV(RMSE) – Less than 25%  2.   NMBE – Less than 0.5%  3.   Savings Uncertainty – Less than 50% at a 90% confidence level, for 10% savings at a minimum  The coefficient of determinatio n ( R2 ) was also calculated for the model. The model was developed for the model training period using the LBNL TOWT modeling algorithm with data in daily time intervals The model accuracy metrics are shown for each (project name) in the Attachment. The models met the accuracy criteria.  4.4. Reporting Period  Reporting Period Data Collection  Example text below.  Data will be continuously collected throughout the baseline, installation, and reporting periods. The planned reporting period’s data collection will be for a period of one year. The data to be collected and their sources are the same as used in the baseline period: electric and natural gas energy use, ambient temperature, and (building) operation periods.  On-Site Generation  Example text below.  The (project name) may have plans to install photovoltaic (PV) systems. For the installed PV system, system size and the date it becomes operational will be obtained, and electric generation data collected. PG&E may switch to a net meter, in which case data for the energy delivered and received from the grid will be obtained. Reporting period models will be based on the electric energy that the building consumes, which is the energy delivered from the grid plus the PV generation energy less the energy sent back to the grid. Per CPUC requirements, a non-IOU analysis will be performed, as described in Section 4.6.  Updated Baseline Model Development  Example text below.  IN case of delays and in order to adhere to the 18 month limit for installation, the baseline period may be updated to the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the first measure installation. A baseline model will be developed using the baseline period energy use, ambient temperature, and other\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  48  independent variable data, using the same modeling algorithm. Its goodness of fit and accuracy metrics must also meet the NMEC requirements and will be updated.  Reporting Period  Example text below.  The planned reporting period start date is recommended to immediately follow the ECM implementation period. However, the actual start date will be jointly decided by the (customer name) and PG&E.  Reporting Period Modeling Algorithm  Example text below.  The reporting period will use the same modeling algorithm as the baseline period for the (project name) electric and natural gas use data. The daily time interval will be used to minimize variability in data and match the modeling setup for the baseline period.  Indicator variables will be used to identify the same operating periods in the post-installation period as were used in the baseline period, such as holidays, in-session and out-of-session periods. The indicator variables will be used to assure the correct adjustments are made to both baseline and reporting period models when estimating normalized savings.  Reporting Period Model Accuracy Metrics  Example text below.  The reporting period model’s accuracy metrics, including NMBE and CV(RMSE) are the same as for the baseline period. This section will include graphs of the reporting period models once the post- implementation data has been collected.  The acceptance criteria for the reporting period model accuracy metrics are as follows:  1.   CV(RMSE) – Less than 25%  2.   NMBE – Less than 0.5%  4.5. Non-Routine Adjustments  Example text below.  Non-routine events will be identified by a significant increase or decrease in energy usage that cannot be fully explained or predicted by the reporting period model. The NRE will be identified using data visualizations or an owner report. This requires frequent contact with the (customer), data collection, and analysis throughout the reporting period.  Once a possible NRE is detected, it will be assessed to determine if its impact merits a detailed analysis. If so, we will assess whether:\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  49  •   the NRE is temporary or permanent?  •   is a constant or variable load?  •   is an added or removed load?  Based on these considerations, we will assess impact of the NRE using at least one of the following methods:  •   Analysis of before/after NRE using metered data  •   Engineering calculations and assumptions  •   Engineering calculations and logged data  Savings will be adjusted accordingly. All calculation data and files will be provided for review.  Accounting for Energy Consumption Changes due to Participation in Other Programs  Example text below.  Should the (customer) participate in other energy efficiency programs, incentives for measures installed under other programs are ineligible under the PG&E NMEC program. As the energy data is collected for each Savings Report (at 12-months), information regarding installation of ‘other program’ measures will be collected, including live calculation savings estimates of those measures. Should other program measures be installed, their savings will be normalized to the CALEE 2018 weather data for the (project’s) climate zone and subtracted from the final normalized savings as described in Section 4.6.  4.6. Normalized Savings Determination  Normalized Savings  Example text below.  Normalized savings are the reductions in energy use that would occur, had the facility operated under a normal set of conditions. In the NMEC program per CPUC rules, normal conditions are defined with California Climate Zone CALEE 2018. 26   Such long-term typical weather data is used so that savings are not estimated with excessively warm or cool weather years, yielding an estimate of typical savings. Normalized savings are defined as the normalized baseline energy use minus the normalized reporting- period energy use.  Normalized energy use will be determined for both the baseline period and the reporting period using models implemented with the same normal conditions weather data. Their predicted energy use (kWh  26   http://www.calmac.org/weather.asp\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  50  usage) under normal conditions will then be compared against each other. This approach reduces the risk of extreme weather years and is required by the HOPPs program.  Peak Savings and Demand Models  Example text below.  The demand savings calculation will follow the DEER Peak Demand Reduction Calculations as described in the Statewide Customized Calculated Savings Guidelines. This requires any grid demand reduction to occur during the three consecutive hottest days, during 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm, for the respective California climate zone. The (customer) is located in California Climate Zone X, which has a DEER Peak Period of <date> through <date>. If the peak period falls on a weekend, the following three weekdays are to be used.  Demand savings are based on energy models constructed using hourly time intervals. Since demand savings are expected from the reduction of the building’s electric energy use, electric data were used to develop hourly energy models. Their goodness of fit metrics are shown in the Attachment. (in cases where the model fails, traditional engineering calculations will be used or demand savings incentives will not be determined.)  Normalized Savings Uncertainty  Example text below.  The resulting estimated savings uncertainty, using the ASHRAE Guideline 14 method for the anticipated project savings, will reflect assumption errors; measurement errors in both the independent and dependent variables; random and systematic measurement errors; and errors in the regression model, which include predictive and normalization errors.  Non-IOU Fuel Analysis  Example text below.  For schools where PV systems (or other on-site generation) are installed, a non-IOU analysis is required. A non-IOU analysis assures that incentives for savings are capped based on what is delivered from the grid through PG&E’s electric meter. For electricity, this analysis is performed on an hourly basis. The non- IOU fuel analysis procedure will follow that described in (PG&E non-IOU analysis reference).  Savings Tracking Frequency  Example text below.  Savings progress reports are short memoranda showing the avoided energy use (savings to date) achieved at specified intervals during the performance period. Savings progress reports will be provided at (3 and 6 months). The 12-month normalized energy savings report will be provided after 12 months of performance period data has been collected. The data to be provided along with these reports will include\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  51  raw, cleaned, and analyzed data. Normalized savings will be reported using graphs and/or other means of data visualization.

Contents of the 12-month Savings Report will be the same as required in the PG&E NMEC M&V Procedures Manual. It will follow the provided Savings Report Template.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  52  Appendix A: Goodness-of-Fit Metrics  Coefficient of Variation of the root mean squared error, CV(RMSE)  𝐶𝑉(𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸) = ( ∑   (𝐸 𝑖   − 𝐸 𝑖 ̂  𝑛 𝑖=1   ) 2  𝑛 − 𝑝   ) 1/2  𝐸 ‾  CV(RMSE)   is a measure of random error between a model’s predictions and the actual data. Generally, we want to minimize this error as much as possible.  Net Mean Bias Error (NMBE)  𝑁𝑀𝐵𝐸 =  ∑   (𝐸 𝑖   − 𝐸 𝑖 ̂  𝑛 𝑖=1   ) (𝑛 − 𝑝) ⋅ 𝐸 ‾  NMBE is a measure of the difference between the model’s predictions of training period total energy use and the actual energy use. This error should be very low.  Coefficient of Determination,   𝑹 𝟐  𝑅 2   = ( 1 𝑛   ∑  (𝑥 𝑖   − 𝑥 ‾)(𝐸 𝑖   − 𝐸 𝑖 ) ‾ 𝜎 𝑥   ∗ 𝜎 𝐸  𝑛 𝑖=1  ) 2  The coefficient of determination describes how well the independent variables explain the variations in the dependent (energy) variable. Higher R2 means the independent variables have more explanatory power. This is an informative metric only, not a criterion, because while the energy use sometimes may not have high variation, an independent variable may adequately ‘explain’ the existing variation in the energy use, despite a low R2.  Fractional Savings Uncertainty  ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014 provided the following ‘fractional savings uncertainty’ formulas as a means to estimate the uncertainty of the savings estimated with this modeling approach. The formulas also enable the estimation of how well we will know savings based only on the baseline model’s goodness of fit, the number of points in the baseline and post-installation periods, the amount of savings, and the level of confidence at which we estimate the uncertainty. For daily or hourly models, they include a correction for autocorrelation. Using these formulas, we can estimate what the savings uncertainty, at 90% confidence, would be for a project that yields 10% savings, with a year of post-installation period monitoring, using a baseline model with its MSE or MSE’ value and a year of baseline data. We want the uncertainty to be low, but the minimum level of uncertainty cannot be greater than +/- 50% at the 90% confidence level. Note the percentage refers to the amount of savings, not to the baseline energy use.  Additional research by LBNL showed that ASHRAE’s formula underestimated uncertainty when used on hourly models, due to the high degree of autocorrelation in the data. This is why uncertainty in hourly models is not reported in the predictability report.\n\nPG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  53  Savings Uncertainty, models with autocorrelation (hourly or daily):  𝑈 =   𝛥𝐸 𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑒,𝑚  𝐸 𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑒,𝑚  =   𝛼 ∗ 𝑡 (1−𝛼)/2,𝑛′−𝑝  𝑚 ∗ 𝐸 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒,𝑛  ‾   ∗ 𝐹   [𝑀𝑆𝐸′(1 + 2/𝑛′) ∗ 𝑚] 1/2  𝑀𝑆𝐸 =   1 𝑛′ − 𝑝   ∑(  𝑛 𝑖  𝑌 𝑖   − 𝑌̂ 𝑖 ) 2  Savings Uncertainty , models without autocorrelation (monthly):  𝑈 =   𝛥𝐸 𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑒,𝑚  𝐸 𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑒,𝑚  =   𝛼 ∗ 𝑡 (1−𝛼)/2,𝑛−𝑝  𝑚 ∗ 𝐸 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒,𝑛  ‾   ∗ 𝐹   [𝑀𝑆𝐸(1 + 2/𝑛) ∗ 𝑚] 1/2  Energy Savings Required for Uncertainty @ 90% Confidence Interval (10%) = 0.1*E  Where:  𝐸 𝑖   is the measured energy use in any time interval, in energy units  𝐸 𝑖 ̂   is the model’s predicted energy use in any time interval, in energy units  𝐸 ‾   is the average energy use over all the time intervals, in energy units  𝐸   is the total energy use over the training time period  𝐸 𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑒,𝑚   is the estimated energy savings over m time periods, in energy units  𝑛   is the number of data points in the training period  𝑝   is the number of parameters in the model  𝑥 𝑖   is the value of the independent variable in any time interval  𝜎 𝑥   is the standard deviation of the distribution of dependent variable values  𝜎 𝐸   is the standard deviation of the distribution of energy use values  𝛥𝐸 𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑒,𝑚   is the absolute precision of the savings estimate over m time periods, in energy units  𝑡   is student’s t-statistic for the specified confidence level and n-p degrees of freedom  𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎   is an equation depending on the analysis time interval:  𝛼   = 1.26   for hourly interval data  𝛼   = −0.00024 𝑀 2   + 0.03535 𝑀   + 1.00286   for daily interval data\n\n#   Measure   Measure Description   Electricity Savings (kWh/yr)  Electric Demand Reduction (kW)  1 Exterior Fixture Retrofit – HID,   CFL,  or Incandescent to LED  It is recommended to replace 61 metal halide, 14 high pressure sodium, nine (9) incandescent fixtures with LED fixtures, relamp 50 2-lamp T8 fixtures with TLED lamps, and relamp one (1) incandescent fixture with an LED lamp.  39,302   0.00  2  Interior Linear Fluorescen t  Relamping – T5 relamp to reduced  wattage  I t   is recommended to relamp 36 4-Lamp T5 fixtures with reduced wattage T5 lamps   713   0.01  3 Lighting- Retrofit Interior Lamps to  LED – T12 or T8 relamp to TLED  It is recommended to relamp ten (10) 1-lamp T8 fixtures, 171 2-lamp T8 fixtures, eight (8) 2-Lamp T12 fixtures, and 446 4-lamp T8 fixtures with TLED lamps.  45,178   0.52  4  Lighting- Interior Fixture Retrofit   –  Incandescent or CFL fixture retrofit to LED  It is recommended to replace six (6) circline fluorescent fixtures with LED fixtures.   407   0.01  5  Lighting- Retrofit Interior Lamps to  LED – Incandescent or CFL relamp  to LED  It is recommended to relamp 52 incandescent fixtures with LED lamps.   4,488   0.06  6  Lighting- LED Exit Signs –  Incandescent or CFL exit sign fixture retrofit to LED  Replace two (2) incandescent exit signs with LED exit signs.   666   0.00  7   Lighting Controls – Interior   and  Exterior Controls  It   is recommended to install Interior and Exterior Controls to reduce unnecesary run hour s   12,670   0.00  103,423   0.60 Total  PG&E M&V Requirements for Site-Level NMEC  54  𝛼   = −0.00022 𝑀 2   + 0.03606 𝑀   + 1.94054   for monthly interval data  M is the number of months in the reporting period  𝑛′   is the number of data points in the model training period, corrected for autocorrelation  𝑚   is the number of data points in the proposed post-installation period  𝐹   is the expected savings, expressed as a fraction of training period energy use  Attachment 1: M&V Data and Modeling Information  Energy Conservation Measures  Table 1: Energy Efficiency Measures’ Summary  Energy Service Accounts and Model Training Period  Table 2: Meter List  Service Account #

Terminology  Baseline Period Model:   A mathematical model, developed using empirical modeling methods (such as regression analysis), using energy use and independent variable data collected during the baseline period.  Performance Period Model:   A mathematical model, developed using empirical modeling methods (such as regression analysis), using energy use and independent variable data collected during the reporting period.  Adjusted Baseline Energy Use:   Energy use that would have occurred in the reporting period had no measures been installed. The adjusted baseline use is determined by inputting independent variable data collected during the reporting period into the baseline model.  Normalized Savings : Savings based on the overall reduction in normalized metered energy consumption.  Savings from a project that are based on ‘normal conditions’ as agreed upon by project stakeholders.  Normalized savings require that both baseline and reporting period energy use be adjusted to a common set of normal conditions.  Normal Conditions : A non-extreme set of conditions that is representative of conditions typically expected for the building and it operations. Savings estimated under normal conditions are expected to represent typical savings for the project and are not over- or under-estimated due to more extreme conditions that may occur in any given reporting period.  Non-Routine Event : An event occurring within the building that affects the energy use measured at the  meter that is not due to the project’s installed energy efficiency measures. Non -routine events may include equipment shut down for maintenance, added building load due to a data center, or sudden change in occupancy such as when building tenants move in or out.  Non-Routine Adjustment : Adjustments to baseline energy use made necessary by the occurrence of non- routine events. Such adjustments are necessary so that the resulting normalized savings are due to the  project’s installed the energy efficiency measu res, and not due to other events that affect the energy use at the meter.  3.

    "text": "STARTING THE FULL EXPANDED MANUAL  ●   PDF #1 — Battery Modeling & Sizing Manual  ●   Part 1 (Expanded)  ●  ●   BATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL  ●   AI ENERGY MODELING PLATFORM  ●   RAW TEXT, HIGH DETAIL, STRUCTURED FORMAT  ●   VERSION 2.0 (EXPANDED)  ●   SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION  ●   1.1 Purpose of This Manual  This manual defines the complete set of engineering principles, mathematical models, calculation rules, AI prompting logic, safety constraints, dispatch strategies, and evaluation procedures required to model and size commercial and industrial battery storage systems. It is designed to be ingested by AI systems and used to support calculations for peak demand reduction, energy arbitrage, demand response participation, backup power analysis, incentive qualification, and integrated multi-measure optimization. All content in this document is deterministic, non-hallucinatory, and based on real-world engineering principles, utility program rules, and industry-standard best practices.  ●   1.2 Background and Intent  Battery modeling is traditionally performed by specialized engineers using a wide range of tools including load modeling platforms, financial spreadsheets, utility-specific tariff engines, or simulation tools like NREL SAM. This document translates these engineering requirements into a fully text-based form so that AI tools can replicate this reasoning without ambiguity, inconsistency, or hallucination. The intent is to give an AI system the capability to:  Perform engineering-grade modeling from minimal inputs.  Suggest optimal battery sizes based on user goals such as ROI, DR eligibility, payback, or bill reduction.  Identify utility program incentives automatically.  Calculate savings using deterministic formulas, not estimates or guesses.  Prevent incorrect or physically impossible modeling results.  Explain results to non-engineers in plain language.  Adapt to varying data quality and automatically fill missing details using established inference logic.  ●   1.3 Types of Battery Systems Addressed  This manual applies to:  Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) BESS systems\n\nNickel manganese cobalt (NMC) systems  AC-coupled BESS  DC-coupled BESS  Modular containerized battery systems  Behind-the-meter commercial batteries  Front-of-the-meter DR-only batteries (with proper modifications)  ●   Not all logic applies to all chemistries, but the overall modeling approach is valid for most commercial systems installed today.  ●   1.4 Inputs Required by the Battery Model  The model can operate with high-quality or low-quality inputs. Ideal inputs include:  Interval data (kW every 15 minutes or 5 minutes)  Monthly billing data (kWh, kW, $)  Utility tariff structure including:  Peak, part-peak, and off-peak energy rates  Non-coincident demand charges  On-peak demand charges  Seasonal variations  Battery specification data from a library including:  Nominal power (kW)  Nominal energy (kWh)  Usable energy fraction  Round-trip efficiency  Allowed C-rates (charge and discharge)  Allowed depth of discharge  Cycle life and warranty constraints  Inverter rating  Site metadata including:  Address  Climate zone  Building type  Square footage  Operating schedule  User-driven goals such as:  Maximize ROI  Minimize payback  Maximize peak shaving  Qualify for a specific DR program  Qualify for SGIP, CEFO, OBF  Find the smallest battery that meets a target demand reduction\n\n●   1.5 Modeling Assumptions  When inputs are missing, the model will rely on inference rules defined in this document.  The model must explicitly state which assumptions were applied.  The model must never fabricate data that violates physical laws.  The model must always disclose uncertainty when assumptions are used.  ●  ●   SECTION 2 — BATTERY FUNDAMENTALS (EXPANDED)  ●   2.1 Power (kW)  Battery power defines the maximum instantaneous rate at which the battery can deliver or absorb energy. It is primarily limited by the inverter but may also be restricted by internal battery chemistry, thermal constraints, and manufacturer-defined discharge limits. Peak shaving depends directly on power rating because demand charges are based on instantaneous or interval demand.  ●   The model must always compare the following:  Battery nominal power  Battery continuous discharge rating  Inverter continuous AC rating  Inverter short-term power rating  Warranty discharge limit  ●   Peak shaving uses the lowest of these values.  ●   2.2 Energy (kWh)  Energy defines how much total energy a battery can store. It determines how long the battery can maintain a specific discharge rate. For example, a 100 kW / 100 kWh battery at 100 kW can discharge for 1 hour. Batteries with high energy relative to power perform better in long-duration events such as extended demand charge windows or DR events requiring more than one hour.  ●   The model must never assume energy equal to nominal energy; it must account for usable capacity and degradation.  ●   2.3 Usable Energy and Depth of Discharge  Actual usable energy depends on:  Depth of discharge limit (e.g., 80–90 percent)  Battery temperature  Age of the battery  Inverter conversion losses  Cell balancing overhead  ●   Usable energy equals:  Nominal energy multiplied by usable fraction.  ●   Different manufacturers define usable fraction differently, such as:  Total battery capacity minus reserved buffer\n\nFull usable window defined in warranty  Charge windows for solar clipping  ●   The model must always track usable energy separately from nominal energy.  ●   2.4 Round Trip Efficiency  Round-trip efficiency is the product of charging efficiency and discharging efficiency. The model must use round-trip efficiency to calculate arbitrage savings and, in some cases, DR energy requirements. Efficiency reduces delivered energy and directly impacts economics.  ●   Typical sources of losses:  Inverter conversion  DC cabling  Internal resistance  Cooling systems  Power control system inefficiencies  ●   The model must not assume constant efficiency. For example, LFP batteries often peak at 94 percent at moderate C-rates but fall to 85 percent during high C-rate discharge or low temperatures.  ●   2.5 Charge Constraints  Charging limits may be lower than discharging limits. Many batteries restrict charging to 0.5C even if discharging can be 1C. AI must check manufacturer charge limits before modeling arbitrage that requires full recharge within off-peak windows.  ●   2.6 Inverter Rating and Derating  Inverter rating is a hard limit on power. The model must always use AC-side inverter power when calculating peak shaving and DR capacity.  ●   Inverters also derate due to:  Temperature  Altitude  Voltage limits  Overload protection  ●   In extreme heat, a 100 kW inverter may be limited to 80 kW.  ●   The model must apply derating rules when environmental data is available.  ●\n\nBATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL  PART 2 — EXTENDED ENGINEERING CONTENT  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 3 — C-RATE, DISCHARGE DURATION, AND PHYSICS (EXTENDED)  3.1 Formal Definition of C-Rate  C-rate is the ratio of a battery’s discharge power to its energy capacity.  C-rate determines how quickly a battery would fully discharge if it maintained rated power for the entire time.  C-rate = Power_kW / Energy_kWh  If P is discharge power and E is usable energy, the theoretical discharge time (ignoring losses) is:  Duration_hours = E / P  Duration_hours = 1 / C  3.2 Derivation from First Principles  Consider a battery with energy density U (Wh) and a discharge rate I (A).  Power is P = V × I  Energy is E = V × Q  C-rate is defined at the cell level as:  C = I / Q\n\nMapping cell-level C to system-level C requires pack-level voltage and capacity normalization. For AI purposes, system-level C is sufficient.  3.3 Why C-Rate Determines Applicability  Battery applications have fundamentally different constraints:  Arbitrage: Requires sustained multi-hour discharge  Peak Shaving: Requires fast ramp AND 1–2 hours of output  DR: Requires sustained output with recovery time  UPS: Requires extremely high C-rate for seconds-long output  3.4 AI Rules Governing C-Rate  AI must enforce these rules:  Rule 1: If duration < peak-event duration → penalize or reject battery  Rule 2: If C-rate > OEM warranty max → reject battery  Rule 3: If C-rate < minimum required for use-case → reject battery  Rule 4: If inverter_kW < battery power → use inverter_kW for C-rate  Rule 5: If temperature derating applies → adjust C-rate downward  Rule 6: Always recompute C-rate using usable energy, not nominal energy  3.5 Typical Manufacturer C-Rate Limits  LFP:  Charge: 0.5C  Discharge: 1.0C  NMC:  Charge: 0.3C–0.5C  Discharge: 0.75C–1.25C  3.6 Degradation Impact of C-Rate  Cycle life decreases approximately exponentially with increasing C-rate:  Life_fraction ≈ exp(−k × (C_rate / C_nominal))  Where k ≈ 1.0–1.5 for most chemistries.  3.7 Real-World C-Rate Constraints  Batteries may advertise 1C capability, but real operational limits reduce this:  Thermal derating at high ambient temperature  Voltage sag under high current  Inverter current limits  PCS firmware caps  DoD and SOC window enforcement\n\nAI must factor these.  SECTION 4 — PEAK DEMAND SHAVING ENGINE (EXTENDED)  4.1 Identifying True Peak Demand  Peak demand is the highest measured demand interval in a billing cycle.  PeakDemand = max(interval_kW)  AI must:  Ignore anomalous single-interval spikes  Identify multi-hour plateau peaks  Determine whether the peak is HVAC-driven, process-driven, or random  4.2 Peak Event Segmentation  To model shaving, AI must identify the “peak event window” — the contiguous time span around the max demand during which demand exceeds a threshold (e.g., 90% of the peak).  EventWindow = intervals where kW >= 0.9 × PeakDemand  This gives event duration:  EventDuration = length(EventWindow)  4.3 Peak Shaving Algorithm  Given battery_kW and battery_kWh:  MaxReduction_kW = min(battery_kW, inverter_kW)  MaxPossibleDuration = battery_kWh / MaxReduction_kW  If MaxPossibleDuration >= EventDuration:  EffectiveReduction = MaxReduction_kW  Else  EffectiveReduction = battery_kWh / EventDuration  4.4 Annual Demand Savings Formula  DemandSavings = EffectiveReduction × DemandCharge × 12  DemandCharge may have:  Non-coincident component  On-peak component  Seasonal component\n\nAI must always select the applicable demand charge for the peak period.  4.5 Edge Cases  Case: Peak event lasts 3 hours; duration = 2 hours  → AI must proportionally reduce savings  Case: Battery discharge capped at inverter  → Use inverter_kW  Case: Two peaks of equal size  → Only the highest month matters  → But AI should warn if modeling uncertainty exists  Case: Negative battery savings due to DR reservation  → AI must detect conflicts between DR and peak shaving  4.6 AI Guardrails  Guardrail 1: Never produce “peak”, “part-peak”, and “off-peak” demand savings. Demand is one number.  Guardrail 2: Never assume spike-shaving is sustainable.  Guardrail 3: Always validate shaving duration.  Guardrail 4: Document any assumptions imposed due to missing interval data.  SECTION 5 — ARBITRAGE ENGINE (EXTENDED)  5.1 Time-of-Use Arbitrage Prerequisites  Arbitrage requires price spread > 0:  Spread = PeakRate − OffPeakRate  If Spread <= 0: ArbitrageSavings = 0  AI must not rely on part-peak arbitrage unless user explicitly requests it.  5.2 Charging Constraint  Battery must recharge during off-peak window.  EnergyRequiredForNextDay = RawDailyDischarge  ChargeCapacity = InverterLimit × OffPeakHours  If ChargeCapacity < EnergyRequired:  DailyDischarge = ChargeCapacity × Efficiency\n\n5.3 Daily Discharge Computation  RawDailyDischarge = min(batt_kW × ArbitrageHours, batt_kWh)  DeliveredEnergy = RawDailyDischarge × RoundTripEfficiency  5.4 Annual Arbitrage  AnnualDischarge_kWh = DeliveredEnergy × 365  AnnualArbitrageSavings = AnnualDischarge_kWh × Spread  5.5 Multi-Period Arbitrage  AI should only use:  Off-peak charge  On-peak discharge  Part-peak should only be used if TOU structure requires it.  5.6 AI Guardrails  Guardrail: Never triple-count arbitrage across peak, part-peak, off-peak.  Guardrail: Arbitrage only occurs once per day unless user specifies multi-cycle mode.  Guardrail: AI must check DR conflicts.

Voltage = OpenCircuitVoltage − InternalResistance * Current  Because power equals voltage multiplied by current, high C-rates reduce effective AC output.  AI must consider that real delivered kW may be lower than nameplate power when:  C-rate exceeds 1  Battery is cold  Battery is near maximum or minimum SOC  Voltage derating is imposed  6.2 Thermal Rise from High C-Rate  Heat generation is proportional to current squared multiplied by internal resistance:  Heat = I^2 * R  High C-rate increases current linearly but increases heat quadratically.  Batteries surpass thermal limits at high C-rates, triggering automatic derating.  AI must model thermal derating when:  Ambient temperature exceeds 35°C  Battery cabinet is in poor ventilation  Battery performs multiple cycles per day  6.3 Ramp Rate Requirements  Some applications (demand response, grid services, UPS) require fast ramp.  RampRate = dP/dt\n\nBattery ramp rate limited by:  Inverter current  PCS firmware  Grid code requirements  Cell chemistry limitations  AI must not model DR participation if ramp rate < required program ramp rate.  6.4 SOC Window Requirements  Batteries often operate only within a specific state of charge window.  For example:  Minimum SOC = 10%  Maximum SOC = 90%  Usable SOC window = 80% of nameplate energy  AI must always enforce SOC windows during charging and discharging.  6.5 C-Rate Impact on Efficiency  At higher C-rates, round-trip efficiency decreases.  Approximation used in modeling:  Efficiency(C) = BaseEff − (C − 0.5)/10  Where BaseEff = 0.92 for LFP and 0.88 for NMC.  AI must penalize arbitrage savings when discharge C-rate > 0.75.  6.6 Mathematical Validation Checks for AI  Check 1: If C > 2, reject operation  Check 2: If thermal_rise > OEM_max_temp, derate battery_kW  Check 3: If voltage_sag causes inverter clipping, reduce AC_kW  Check 4: If SOC_window < required discharge, reject event modeling  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 7 — DEGRADATION, LIFETIME MODELING, AND WARRANTY LOGIC (EXTENDED)  7.1 Two Types of Battery Degradation  Calendar aging: time-based reduction in capacity  Cycle aging: usage-based reduction in capacity  AI must track both.  7.2 Calendar Aging Model  Annual calendar degradation typically ranges from 1.0% to 2.5% per year.\n\nDegradationCalendar = k_calendar * Years  Where k_calendar ≈ 0.015 for LFP  7.3 Cycle Aging Model  Cycle aging depends on depth of discharge (DoD).  Common empirical relationship:  DegradationCycle = k_cycle * (DoD)^α  α ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 depending on chemistry.  k_cycle based on cycle count rating.  Example:  If cell is rated for 6000 cycles at 80% DoD:  k_cycle = 1 / 6000  AI must compute degraded capacity after n cycles.  7.4 Effective Battery Capacity Over Time  EffectiveCapacity(year) = NominalCapacity * (1 − DegradationCalendar − DegradationCycle)  AI must use degraded capacity for annual savings, not initial capacity.  7.5 Warranty Enforcement Rules  AI must reject scenarios where:  CyclesPerYear > WarrantyCyclesPerYear  C-rate > OEM maximum  Average temperature > warranty temperature  DoD exceeds warranty DoD limit  7.6 Battery Replacement Modeling  For long-term NPV, the battery may need replacement after useful life.  AI must incorporate mid-life replacement if analysis horizon > expected life.  7.7 Real-World Considerations  Peak shaving uses fewer cycles than arbitrage; arbitrage-heavy models degrade faster.  DR participation can cause deeper cycles, shortening life.  AI must identify the dominant degradation mechanism for each use-case.  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 8 — DEMAND RESPONSE MODELING (EXTENDED)  8.1 Types of DR Programs  There are multiple forms of DR programs:\n\nDay-Ahead DR  Real-Time DR  Capacity Bidding  Emergency Load Reduction  Ancillary services DR  Fast Frequency Response  AI must differentiate between them.  8.2 DR Requirements Breakdown  Each DR program has:  Event duration  Event frequency per year  Ramp rate requirements  Notification time  Sustained output requirements  Reset/Recovery requirements  For example:  A DR program may require:  Sustain 100 kW for 4 hours  Up to 20 events per year  10-minute response time  AI must check ALL requirements.  8.3 DR Mathematical Eligibility  Battery must satisfy:  Power requirement:  Battery_kW >= DR_committed_kW  Duration requirement:  Battery_kWh / DR_committed_kW >= DR_event_duration  Recovery requirement:  Available_offpeak_hours * ChargePower >= energy_depleted  AI must reject DR participation when any requirement is violated.  8.4 DR Revenue Model  DRRevenue = CommittedKW * EventHours * EventCount * ProgramRate  If DR is capacity-based, AI must add monthly or annual payments independent of\n\nevents:  DRCapacityPayment = CommittedKW * CapacityRate * Months  8.5 Interaction Between DR and Arbitrage  Arbitrage revenue and DR revenue may conflict because:  Battery must reserve SOC for DR event periods  Battery cannot be simultaneously dispatched for shaving and arbitrage  AI must decide optimal dispatch strategy based on user goals.  8.6 DR Priority Logic  If goal = maximize DR revenue:  Reserve SOC for DR  Reduce arbitrage cycles  If goal = maximize bill savings:  Prioritize demand shaving + arbitrage  Allow DR only if non-conflicting  8.7 Multi-Cycle DR Events  If program has two events per day:  Battery must recharge between events  AI must enforce inter-event recharge feasibility.  8.8 Fast Response DR  Fast-acting DR requires:  Ramp < 1 second  C-rate > 2  In practice, most C&I batteries are not eligible  AI must warn and automatically mark “Not Eligible”.  8.9 Real-World DR Mistakes AI Must Avoid  Do not assume DR events last 15 minutes  Do not assume arbitrary number of events  Do not assume unlimited recharge capability  Do not assume arbitrage is possible on same day as DR event  Do not assume events occur in off-peak windows  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 9 — BATTERY DISPATCH ALGORITHMS (FULL LOGIC)  9.1 Time-Series Dispatch for Peak Shaving  At each interval t:\n\nIf interval_kW > TargetPeak:  Discharge = min(Battery_kW, interval_kW − TargetPeak)  SOC = SOC − Discharge * interval_duration  Stop discharging when SOC_window limit reached  9.2 Time-Series Dispatch for Arbitrage  Charge during lowest-priced periods until SOC max  Discharge during highest-priced periods until SOC min  AI must enforce hourly constraints  9.3 Dispatch for DR  Upon DR notification:  Instantly reserve energy equal to:  DR_committed_kW * DR_event_duration  and halt all arbitrage until event ends  9.4 Conflict Resolution  Priority = user goal  If goal is DR → DR > shaving > arbitrage  If goal is shaving → shaving > DR > arbitrage  If goal is ROI → maximize total annual benefit via optimization loop  9.5 Optimization Loop  For each battery in library:  Simulate peak shaving  Simulate arbitrage  Simulate DR  Compute net benefit  Select battery that maximizes user objective  9.6 Multi-Day Simulation Window  AI must ensure battery ends each day with acceptable SOC for next-day events.  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 10 — EXTENDED FINANCIAL MODELING  (coming next in Part 4 if you confirm)  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  THIS IS ONLY PART 3.

The financial model must translate battery dispatch into annual dollar savings, incentive value, capital cost, and long-term profitability metrics. The financial model provides decision-grade information for project scoping, proposal creation, and multi-measure optimization.  10.2 Core Financial Metrics  The model calculates the following:  Annual demand savings  Annual arbitrage savings  Annual DR revenue  Annual maintenance cost  Annual net savings  Simple payback  Net present value (NPV)  Internal rate of return (IRR)  Levelized cost of energy storage (LCOS)  CEFO or OBF loan eligibility  SGIP incentive value  10.3 Capital Cost (CAPEX)  CAPEX includes:  Battery modules  Inverter and PCS  Switchgear  Transformer or service upgrades  Installation labor  Engineering  Permitting  Sales tax  Commissioning  Controls and EMS  The model must allow CAPEX to be reduced by incentives when rules permit.\n\n10.4 Annual Operating Expenses (OPEX)  Opex includes:  Annual maintenance contract  EMS software licensing  Warranty extension if required  Insurance  Performance testing  Cyclical cost adjustments  AI must assume O&M cost is non-zero unless explicitly set to zero.  10.5 Annual Net Savings  Annual net savings equal:  NetAnnualSavings = DemandSavings + ArbitrageSavings + DRRevenue − AnnualOandM  AI must prevent negative net savings unless intentionally modeling a poor asset.  10.6 Simple Payback Calculation  SimplePayback = CAPEX / NetAnnualSavings  AI must guard against:  Zero division errors  NetAnnualSavings < 0  Reporting negative payback  10.7 Time Value of Money  When calculating NPV, cashflow discounting must be applied:  NPV = −CAPEX + sum(NetAnnualSavings / (1 + discount_rate)^t)  AI must allow user-adjustable discount rates.  10.8 IRR Calculation  IRR is the discount rate where NPV equals zero.  AI must not attempt symbolic derivation; instead use:  Newton-Raphson iterative approximation  Bisection search  Or internal function if provided\n\n10.9 Lifecycle Replacement Modeling  If analysis horizon exceeds battery life, replacement cost must be modeled:  ReplacementYear = expected_lifetime  ReplacementCost = CAPEX * replacement_fraction  DiscountedReplacementCost = ReplacementCost / (1 + discount_rate)^ReplacementYear  10.10 Salvage Value  If battery life extends beyond analysis period, salvage value may be included:  SalvageValue = RemainingValue / (1 + discount_rate)^analysis_years  AI must not overstate salvage value.  10.11 Fuel Adjustment Logic  If the battery reduces gas heating demand (through HVAC controls interaction), therms savings must be included. AI must use proper rates for therms.  10.12 Multi-Tariff Adjustment  If the battery changes the customer’s tariff (for example, qualifying for a lower demand charge), AI must calculate:  OldBill  NewBill  Savings = OldBill − NewBill  Tariff migration is one of the strongest value drivers.  10.13 SGIP Incentive Modeling  SGIP includes:  Base incentive  Equity resiliency adder  Large storage step-downs  Discharge cycling bonus  AI must calculate:  SGIPIncentive = kWh * incentive_rate  Adjusted for:  Step number  Equity eligibility\n\nMaximum cap rules  Operating profile  10.14 CEFO / OBF Loan Modeling  AI must enforce:  CreditCheckPass  SimplePayback <= program maximum  MaxTerm <= program limit  CAPEX < program cap  Loan payment formula:  Payment = CAPEX * (r / (1 − (1 + r)^(−TermMonths)))  10.15 AI Guardrails for Finance  AI must check:  If DR revenue > theoretical maximum → error  If TWh-level savings appear → error  If NPV extremely large → check inputs  If arbitrage savings exceed cycle capability → adjust  If battery cycles per year exceed warranty → warn or reject  SECTION 11 — MULTI-USE STACKING, INTERACTION, AND PRIORITY RULES  11.1 Purpose  Multi-use stacking allows a battery to perform multiple value streams simultaneously. However, improper stacking can double-count savings or violate technical constraints.  11.2 Value Streams That Can Be Stacked  Demand shaving  Arbitrage  Demand response  Backup power (not monetized but affects sizing)  Solar clipping  Tariff optimization  11.3 Mutual Exclusivity Rules  AI must enforce:\n\nDemand shaving and arbitrage can coexist  DR and arbitrage conflict during event days  Demand shaving and DR can coexist if event does not overlap peak  Backup power reduces available SOC window for other uses  Solar clipping coexists with most functions  11.4 Priority Assignment  Priority = user goal  If user goal = maximize ROI:  1 arbitrage  2 demand shaving  3 DR  If goal = maximize demand shaving:  1 demand shaving  2 arbitrage  3 DR  If goal = maximize DR revenue:  1 DR  2 peak shaving  3 arbitrage  These determine SOC reserve strategy.  11.5 Dispatch Coordination  At each time interval:  Step 1: Check DR event  Step 2: Check peak shaving requirements  Step 3: Check arbitrage opportunity  Step 4: Maintain SOC window  11.6 SOC Reserve Logic  If DR window is predicted:  Reserve energy equal to DR_duration * DR_committed_kW  11.7 Multi-Day Optimization  AI must check:  Battery ends each day with SOC sufficient for next day  Peak events do not occur immediately after long DR events\n\n11.8 Stacking Failure Cases  Case: DR event requires 4 hours at 200 kW but battery is 200 kW / 200 kWh  Case: Arbitrage cycle leaves battery empty during peak  Case: Overlapping DR and peak shaving windows  Case: Weekly event schedule exceeds weekly recharge capacity  AI must detect these scenarios and choose:  Reject stacking scenario  Resize battery  Change dispatch priority  SECTION 12 — MATHEMATICAL DERIVATIONS FOR MODELING  12.1 Peak Shaving Derivation  Given interval demand d(t), target peak T, battery discharge P_batt, duration D, and SOC:  If d(t) > T:  P_shave(t) = min(P_batt, d(t) − T)  Cumulative energy needed for event:  E_event = sum(P_shave(t) * Δt)  Battery must satisfy:  E_event <= usable_energy  If not:  Scale P_shave(t) downward uniformly.  12.2 Arbitrage Derivation  Let price schedule be p(t), off_peak_price = p_low, peak_price = p_high.  Battery charges during t where price = p_low.  Battery discharges during t where price = p_high.  Energy delivered:  E_del = min(P_batt * H_high, usable_energy) * efficiency  Annual arbitrage savings:  S_arbitrage = E_del * 365 * (p_high − p_low)\n\n12.3 DR Derivation  Event revenue:  R = P_commit * H_event * N_events * rate_event  Eligibility requires:  usable_energy >= P_commit * H_event  recharge_feasible = (charge_hours * charge_power) >= (P_commit * H_event)  12.4 Optimization Problem  Let V(battery) = NPV(battery)  User goal transforms into:  Select battery b in library such that:  b* = argmax V(b)  Subject to constraints:  C_rate_limit  duration_limit  discount_rate  loan eligibility  incentive eligibility  This is a bounded discrete optimization problem.  12.5 Battery Lifetime Derivation  If cycle degradation = f(DoD), then after n cycles:  Capacity_n = Capacity_0 * (1 − sum(f(DoD_i))) − calendar_degradation  12.6 Efficiency as Function of C  Efficiency(C) = η0 − α*(C − C_ref)^2  Where α determined empirically.  AI must use η0 = base efficiency and C_ref = mid C-rate.  SECTION 13 — REAL-WORLD WORKED EXAMPLES (EXTENDED)  13.1 Hospital with 400 kW Peak  Battery options: 100 kW / 400 kWh, 200 kW / 600 kWh  Demand charge = 25 per kW-month  Arbitrage spread = 0.15  DR event = 3 hours, 10 events/year, 8 dollars per kW-event\n\nCompute:  Peak shaving  Arbitrage  DR  NPV  IRR  Payback  Cycle life  Warrantable operation  13.2 Industrial Facility with Long Peaks  Peaks last 2 to 3 hours, seldom below 1 hour.  Batteries under 1C insufficient.  AI must resize batteries accordingly.  13.3 School with Low Afternoon Peaks  Smaller batteries may achieve similar savings.  AI must detect diminishing returns.  13.4 Office Building with Zero Arbitrage Spread  Arbitrage automatically disabled.  Peak shaving dominates.  SECTION 14 — VALIDATION TEST SUITE  Test 1: Oversized battery must be rejected  Test 2: Undersized battery must be penalized  Test 3: Arbitrage-only scenarios must show zero demand savings  Test 4: DR-only scenarios must show zero arbitrage  Test 5: Duration violation must reduce savings  Test 6: C-rate > 2 must generate error  Test 7: Charge window insufficient must reduce performance  Test 8: Inverter limit must cap battery_kW  Test 9: Thermal limit must reduce battery_kW  Test 10: Round-trip efficiency must reduce arbitrage savings  SECTION 15 — AI BEHAVIOR AND GUARDRAILS\n\nAI must:  Always enforce physics.  Never hallucinate battery capability.  Never produce impossible savings.  Never double-count.  Always respect SOC windows.  Always report assumptions.  Always disclose uncertainty.  Always request missing inputs.  Always run constraint checks.  Always verify duration.  Reject DR participation if ramp or duration invalid.  Reject arbitrage if spread <= 0.  Reject peak shaving if event cannot be sustained.  Reject modeling when inputs violate warranty.  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  Continuing   PDF #1 — Battery Modeling & Sizing Manual  PART 5   —   Battery Safety, Thermal Modeling, EMS Logic  (Structured raw text, extremely detailed, no formatting, no markdown)  I will keep expanding the document at the same level of depth and length.

Safety models are crucial for ensuring that the AI never suggests operating parameters that violate physical, chemical, manufacturer, or code limitations. Safety modeling protects against fire risk, thermal runaway, overcurrent conditions, and inverter overload.  16.2 Thermal Runaway Basics  Thermal runaway is a condition where heat generation exceeds heat dissipation, causing exponential temperature rise. It is triggered by:  Internal short circuits  Overcharging  Excessive discharge current  Mechanical penetration  Manufacturing defects  Elevated ambient temperatures  AI must never propose operating conditions that risk thermal runaway. Batteries must stay within the temperature envelopes stated by the manufacturer.  16.3 Temperature Operating Ranges  Typical LFP operating range:  Discharge: −20C to +55C  Charge: 0C to +55C  Optimal performance: 15C to 35C  Charging below freezing causes lithium plating.  Discharging above 55C accelerates degradation.  16.4 Thermal Derating  Battery inverters and PCS systems derate power based on temperature. Derating usually begins around 35C and becomes severe above 45C.  AI must reduce effective battery power when ambient temperatures exceed thresholds.  16.5 Cooling Requirements  Forced air cooling or liquid cooling systems maintain cell temperature. If cooling capacity is insufficient, battery output is reduced.  AI must check if cooling power is adequate for high C-rates.  16.6 Chemical Stability  LFP batteries are more stable than NMC and less prone to fire propagation. AI must identify chemistry type if known and adjust risk factors accordingly.\n\n16.7 Safety Certification Rules  AI must assume all batteries must comply with:  UL 9540  UL 9540A  NFPA 855  IEEE 1547  Local jurisdiction fire code spacing and ventilation  Even in modeling, AI cannot ignore these constraints when suggesting equipment.  16.8 Heat Generation Model  Heat = I^2 * R_internal  Where I = current, R_internal = internal resistance.  AI must model thermal rise for high C-rate operations and reduce battery power if thermal model predicts overheating.  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 17 — STATE OF CHARGE (SOC) WINDOW AND CONTROL LOGIC  17.1 SOC Window Definition  Batteries operate within a SOC window that protects cell health.  Example:  Minimum SOC = 10 percent  Maximum SOC = 90 percent  Usable SOC window = 80 percent  17.2 SOC Window Enforcement  AI must never allow discharge outside the SOC window.  If SOC hits min level, discharge ends.  If SOC hits max level, charging stops.  17.3 SOC Buffering for DR  When DR is expected, AI must reserve SOC equal to:  Reserve_kWh = DR_committed_kW * DR_duration  17.4 SOC Buffering for Peak Shaving  AI must ensure the battery has enough stored energy to cover the next expected peak event. If not, arbitrage cycles must be reduced.  17.5 SOC Reset Logic  After DR events or deep cycles, battery must return to neutral SOC. Recharge feasibility must be checked based on:\n\nAvailable charging hours  Charge power limits  Off peak tariff windows  Grid constraints  17.6 Long-Term SOC Behavior  Frequently operating at low or high SOC accelerates degradation. AI must avoid:  Keeping SOC < 20 percent for long durations  Keeping SOC > 80 percent for long durations  Repeated heavy cycling without rest periods  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 18 — BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (BMS) LOGIC  18.1 What the BMS Does  The BMS monitors and controls:  Cell voltages  Cell temperatures  Current flow  SOC calculation  Balancing  Fault detection  Overcharge protection  Over-discharge protection  Thermal management  AI must assume all BMS protections are active and override aggressive dispatch profiles.  18.2 Overcurrent Protection  Battery cannot exceed manufacturer-defined current. AI must compute:  MaxCurrent = P_max / V_nominal  If modeled current > MaxCurrent, reduce discharge.  18.3 Cell Balancing Behavior  Balancing makes top-of-charge slower and reduces effective usable capacity at high SOC.  AI must account for decreased charge rate near the SOC ceiling.  18.4 Fault Modes  The BMS will shut down the battery for:  Overvoltage\n\nUndervoltage  Overcurrent  Overtemperature  Undertemperature  Cell imbalance  Isolation fault  Communication failure  AI must reduce or stop modeling for faulty conditions.  18.5 String and Module Limitations  If battery consists of parallel strings:  Each string must stay within its voltage and thermal window.  AI must avoid uneven load distribution.  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 19 — ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMS) DISPATCH LOGIC  19.1 Purpose of EMS  The EMS orchestrates battery dispatch across multiple goals. AI must emulate the behavior of EMS systems used in real facilities.  19.2 EMS Dispatch Hierarchy  Dispatch priority depends on user-selected goal.  For ROI mode:  1 Arbitrage  2 Peak shaving  3 DR  For demand reduction mode:  1 Peak shaving  2 DR  3 Arbitrage  For DR revenue mode:  1 DR  2 Peak shaving  3 Arbitrage  19.3 Look-Ahead Logic  EMS predicts load and rates using:  Historical data\n\nWeather  Schedule  Utility pricing  AI must implement basic predictive logic.  19.4 Dispatch Algorithm Loop  For each interval:  Check DR schedule  Check peak condition  Check arbitrage window  Check SOC limits  Dispatch accordingly  Update SOC  Adjust next interval instructions  19.5 Dispatch Safeguards  Battery cannot:  Discharge twice in one period  Charge while peak shaving  Discharge when DR reserve required  Charge beyond limits  Exceed SOC window  Violate thermal constraints  19.6 Event Clustering  EMS must detect clustered peaks (multiple peaks in close succession) and choose which peaks to shave.  19.7 Demand Spike Identification  Spikes lasting only one interval should be ignored or treated differently than sustained peaks.  19.8 EMS Fail-Safe Logic  If the model predicts insufficient energy for next event, EMS configures battery to reduce arbitrage cycles.  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  SECTION 20 — BATTERY SAFETY AND CODE COMPLIANCE  20.1 Fire Code Separation Distances  AI must assume standard separation rules:  3 feet minimum between cabinets\n\n24 feet from building openings (varies by jurisdiction)  Dedicated fire suppression required  20.2 Hazard Mitigation  Fire detection  Thermal runaway detection  Manual disconnects  Smoke dampers  20.3 AI Constraints  AI must not propose:  Batteries installed in unsafe locations  Operations that violate UL or NFPA standards  Non-warrantable operation  ------------------------------------------------------------  BATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL  PART 6 — OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 21 — OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVES  21.1 Purpose of Optimization  Battery systems can be optimized for different user-defined goals. The AI must determine which goal applies and adjust modeling priorities accordingly. Optimization is not merely selecting the highest NPV; it may involve:  Maximizing demand shaving  Maximizing arbitrage profit  Maximizing DR revenue  Qualifying for incentives  Meeting a payback target\n\nMeeting backup power requirements  Minimizing capital cost  Minimizing battery size  Balancing multiple value streams simultaneously  21.2 Supported Optimization Goals  Goal 1: Maximize NPV  Goal 2: Maximize net annual savings  Goal 3: Minimize simple payback  Goal 4: Maximize DR revenue  Goal 5: Maximize demand charge reduction  Goal 6: Minimize battery size that meets performance  Goal 7: Qualify for incentive program  Goal 8: Meet a required peak reduction  Goal 9: Provide limited backup power  Goal 10: Provide solar-self consumption optimization  AI must map user statements to one of these.  21.3 Multi-Objective Optimization  When goals conflict, AI must use weighted scoring. For example:  TotalScore = α * NPV + β * PeakReduction + γ * DRRevenue  Where α, β, γ are goal-dependent weights.  Examples:  If user goal = DR → γ high  If user goal = payback → α and β dominate  If user wants smallest capex → size penalty applies  21.4 Optimizing Over a Battery Library  For each battery in the library:  Simulate peak shaving  Simulate arbitrage  Simulate DR  Simulate degradation  Calculate financial metrics  Apply constraints  Score battery  Pick highest scoring battery  21.5 Dominance Rules  Battery A dominates Battery B if:\n\nA has higher net present value  A meets all technical constraints B meets  A costs less or equal  A meets user’s goal better than B  AI must automatically eliminate dominated options.  ------------------------------------------------------------  BATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL  PART 7 — DISPATCH SIMULATION & TIME-SERIES MODEL  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 22 — DISPATCH SIMULATION LOGIC  22.1 Purpose  Real-world batteries operate in time-series.

Update prices  2.   Update load  3.   Update SOC  4.   Decide if shaving needed  5.   Decide if arbitrage possible  6.   Decide if DR event active  7.   Determine discharge or charge power  8.   Apply inverter and SOC limits  9.   Update performance metrics  22.4 SOC Forecasting  To avoid failing next-day events, AI must forecast future SOC needs based on predicted load and event schedule.  22.5 Adaptive Dispatch  If battery has insufficient SOC before a known event:  Reduce arbitrage  Increase charging  Shift strategy  22.6 DR Event Dispatch  During DR event:  Battery must deliver committed kW throughout event.  No arbitrage allowed.  No peak shaving allowed (unless user goal requires it).  Transmission losses must be included.  22.7 Backup Mode When Required  If battery reserved for backup:\n\nSOC must be raised to target backup SOC each day.  Peak shaving and arbitrage may be limited.  ------------------------------------------------------------  BATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL  PART 8 — FULL END-TO-END WORKED EXAMPLE  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 23 — EXAMPLE: HOSPITAL WITH BATTERY  23.1 Site Data  Facility: Hospital  Peak: 400 kW  Demand charge: 25 dollars per kW-month  Arbitrage spread: 0.15  DR event: 3 hrs  Battery library: various sizes  23.2 Select Candidate Battery  Example battery: 100 kW / 400 kWh, 90% efficiency.  23.3 Peak Shaving  Peak reduction = min(100, 400) = 100 kW  Annual demand savings = 100 * 25 * 12 = 30,000  23.4 Arbitrage  Raw discharge = 100 * 4 = 400 kWh\n\nDelivered = 400 * 0.9 = 360 kWh/day  Annual arbitrage = 360 * 365 * 0.15 = 19,710  23.5 DR  Event energy = 100 * 3 = 300 kWh  Battery supports event fully.

These constraints must be respected by any engineering model, dispatch strategy, or optimization engine. Technical constraints exist to prevent:  Overloading  Overheating  Overvoltage\n\nUndervoltage  Exceeding warranty limits  Accelerated degradation  Safety hazards  Invalid modeling physics  An AI energy modeling engine must implement all constraints deterministically and must never allow exceptions.  1.2 Constraint Categories  This manual organizes battery constraints into eight primary categories:  1.   Inverter-limited constraints  2.   Cell chemistry constraints  3.   Thermal constraints  4.   Voltage and current constraints  5.   SOC window constraints  6.   Depth of discharge constraints  7.   Manufacturer warranty constraints  8.   Grid-code and safety constraints  1.3 Constraint Enforcement Hierarchy  The AI must enforce constraints in the following order:  Level 1: Safety constraints  Level 2: Manufacturer constraints  Level 3: Thermal constraints  Level 4: Inverter constraints  Level 5: Chemistry constraints  Level 6: Warranty constraints  Level 7: Economic optimization  Nothing overrides safety or manufacturer constraints, regardless of economic benefit.\n\nSECTION 2 — INVERTER-LIMITED CONSTRAINTS (DERIVATION)  2.1 Inverter as the Primary AC-Side Constraint  A battery’s inverter converts DC energy into AC power. The inverter generally becomes the dominant limit on power output, even when the battery pack could theoretically provide more.  Let:  P_batt = DC-side maximum discharge capability  P_inv = AC inverter rating  P_AC = actual delivered AC power  The constraint is:  P_AC = min(P_batt, P_inv)  2.2 Inverter Clipping  Inverter clipping occurs when battery DC-side power exceeds inverter AC-side rating.  If P_batt > P_inv:  ClippingLoss = P_batt − P_inv  EnergyDelivered = P_inv × duration  This means adding more DC battery modules does   not   increase AC power if inverter is undersized.  AI must detect and prevent overvaluation of oversized DC energy.  2.3 Inverter Efficiency  Inverters have conversion efficiency:  η_inv ≈ 0.96−0.99 depending on load.  Actual AC output:  P_AC = P_DC × η_inv  2.4 Partial Load Efficiency Curve  Inverter efficiency drops at low loading. Typical curve:  η_inv(P) = η_max − α(1 − P/P_inv)^2\n\nWhere α ~ 0.04 for many systems.  AI must reduce arbitrage savings when battery frequently operates at low AC loading.  2.5 Inverter Overload Capability  Some inverters support short-duration overload (e.g., 110 percent for 10 seconds).  AI must not misuse this for peak shaving or DR modeling.  Overload is for fault ride-through only.  SECTION 3 — CELL CHEMISTRY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL LIMITS  3.1 Nernst Equation and Cell Voltage  Battery cell voltage is governed by:  V = V0 + (RT/nF) ln(activities)  During discharge:  Voltage decreases as concentration gradient forms.  High current accelerates voltage sag.  3.2 Internal Resistance  Each battery cell has internal resistance R_int. During discharge:  V_actual = V_OCV − I × R_int  Power delivered:  P = V_actual × I  As current increases:  Voltage sag increases  Power efficiency decreases  Heat increases as I^2 R losses  3.3 Maximum Discharge Current  Maximum current I_max is defined by chemistry.  C-rate = I / Q  Where Q is capacity in amp-hours.\n\nAI must compute:  I_required = P_required / V_nominal  If I_required > I_max → battery cannot supply required power.  3.4 Charge Rate Limitations  Charge rates are usually half of discharge rates for safety.  Lithium plating risk increases dramatically below 0°C.  AI must apply:  If Temperature < 0°C → ChargeRate_max = 0  If 0 < Temperature < 10°C → ChargeRate_max ≤ 0.25C  If Temperature > 35°C → Reduce ChargeRate_max by 10–30 percent  3.5 Cell Balancing Constraints  Cells in a pack must stay balanced within millivolts.  When near 100 percent SOC, balancing circuits activate and reduce charge acceptance.  AI must derate charging near SOC ceiling.  SECTION 4 — THERMAL CONSTRAINTS (EXTENDED DERIVATION)  4.1 Heat Generation  Heat generated:  Q = I^2 × R_internal × t  Higher C-rate → higher heat → thermal risk.  AI must compute predicted internal temperature rise:  ΔT = Q / (m × Cp)  Where:  m = battery mass  Cp = heat capacity  4.2 Cooling System Limits  Cooling power P_cool sets maximum sustainable C-rate.  If Q_gen > P_cool → derating required.\n\nAI must compute:  MaxC_sustainable = sqrt(P_cool / (R_internal × V_nominal))  4.3 Thermal Runaway Threshold  Thermal runaway occurs when:  dT/dt > heat dissipation rate  AI must not operate near these thresholds.  4.4 Ambient Temperature Constraints  At high ambient temperatures:  SOC window shrinks  Charge rate shrinks  Cycle life worsens  Internal resistance increases  AI must derate based on temperature.  4.5 Thermal Degradation Equation  Calendar degradation increases with temperature as Arrhenius relationship:  k = A exp(−Ea / (RT))  Higher T accelerates degradation.  AI must model life reduction at high average temperatures.  SECTION 5 — VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LIMITS  5.1 Voltage Window  Each chemistry has voltage operating window:  LFP: ~2.5V to 3.65V per cell  NMC: ~3.0V to 4.2V per cell  Do NOT allow discharge past lower voltage.  Do NOT allow charge beyond upper voltage.  AI must enforce voltage cutoffs.  5.2 Current Limits  MaxCurrent = C_rate_max × Q\n\nIf required current > MaxCurrent:  Power request must be reduced.  5.3 Voltage Sag Model  At high current:  Voltage drops → reduces power → reduces arbitrage and shaving effectiveness.  AI must compute:  V_loaded = V_OCV − I × R_internal  If V_loaded < inverter_min_voltage → inverter trips.  5.4 Cable and Busbar Constraints  Current flowing through cables generates additional I^2R losses and heating.  AI must enforce limits on wiring.  SECTION 6 — SOC WINDOW CONSTRAINTS (DERIVED)  6.1 SOC Limits Defined by Manufacturer  SOC_min and SOC_max define allowable energy window.  Typical values:  SOC_min = 10 percent  SOC_max = 90 percent  Usable window = 80 percent  AI must enforce:  If SOC <= SOC_min → discharging stops  If SOC >= SOC_max → charging stops  6.2 Dynamic SOC Window Shrinkage  At low temperatures, SOC_min increases.  At high temperatures, SOC_max decreases.  AI must compute adaptive SOC window.  6.3 SOC Calculation  SOC evolves based on:  SOC_next = SOC_curr − (Power * Δt) / UsableEnergy\n\nAI must track SOC continuously.  6.4 SOC Reserve for DR  AI must reserve energy for DR events by ensuring:  SOC >= Reserve_kWh / UsableEnergy  6.5 SOC Hysteresis  SOC boundaries have hysteresis to avoid oscillation.  SECTION 7 — DEPTH OF DISCHARGE AND USABLE ENERGY  7.1 DoD Definition  Depth of Discharge = fraction of usable capacity consumed.  DoD = ΔE / E_usable  7.2 DoD and Lifetime  Cycle life decreases as DoD increases.  Relationship:  Cycles(DoD) = k × DoD^(−α)  Where α ~ 1.2 for LFP and ~1.4 for NMC.  7.3 Partial Cycling  Partial cycles accumulate proportional wear:  CycleEquivalent = sum(DoD_i)  AI must compute cycle-equivalent usage.  7.4 Usable Energy Reduction Over Time  Use:  E_usable(t) = E_initial × (1 − degradation(t))  AI must adjust savings by year.

Warranty violations result in voided support, accelerated failures, thermal risk, or unusable equipment. AI must enforce these constraints with zero tolerance.  8.2 Warranty Operating Envelope  Every battery has a documented warranty operating envelope. These define:  Maximum discharge C-rate  Maximum charge C-rate  Allowed operating temperature range  Maximum number of cycles per year  Maximum depth of discharge  Maximum average DoD  Maximum ramp rates  Maximum calendar years  Retention requirement (e.g., 70 percent capacity at 10 years)\n\nAI must retrieve or infer these if unknown.  8.3 Warranty Capacity Retention Curve  Manufacturers state that battery capacity will degrade according to:  CapacityRetention(t) = C_initial − (k_cal * t) − (k_cycle * CycleEquivalent(t))  Where:  k_cal = calendar degradation rate  k_cycle = cycle-based degradation rate  CycleEquivalent is sum of DoD-weighted cycles.  8.4 Calendar Degradation Derivation  Calendar degradation follows Arrhenius dependence:  k_cal(T) = A * exp(−Ea / (R_gas * T_abs))  Where:  A = pre-exponential factor  Ea = activation energy  T_abs = absolute temperature  R_gas = gas constant  Higher temperature accelerates degradation.  8.5 Cycle Degradation Derivation  Battery lifetime decreases exponentially with DoD.  Empirical relationship:  Cycles(DoD) ≈ C0 * DoD^(−α)  Where α ~1.2–1.5 for Li-ion cells.  AI must compute equivalent cycles as:  CycleEquivalent = Σ(DoD_i)  8.6 Total Lifetime Prediction  RemainingLifeYears = min(  CalendarLifeLimit,  CycleLifeLimit  )  If remaining life < analysis horizon, AI must include replacement cost.\n\n8.7 Warranty DoD Constraint  If DoD > DoD_warranty_limit, operation is invalid.  AI must cap usable energy at warranty DoD.  8.8 Warranty Temperature Constraint  If T < Tmin or T > Tmax, AI must reject the scenario.  Warm climate or cold storage introduces derating or modification.  8.9 Warranty Charge/Discharge Constraints  If requested C-rate > warranty C-rate:  AI must force derating or reject configuration.  8.10 Warranty Cycle Limit per Year  If cycles/year > maximum allowed:  AI must throttle arbitrage cycles  Reduce DR event participation  Adjust savings downward  8.11 Degradation-Cost Modeling  DegradationCost = ReplacementCost / ExpectedCycleLife  AI must subtract degradation costs from annual savings when needed.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 9 — ADVANCED DEGRADATION MODELING  ------------------------------------------------------------  9.1 Two-Dimensional Degradation Matrix  Degradation is a function of both DoD and temperature.  AI must use 2D lookup model:  Degradation(DoD, Temp) = f1(DoD) + f2(Temp) + interaction_term  Cycles degrade faster at high temperatures and high DoD.\n\n9.2 Rainflow Counting Method  For irregular cycling profiles, the industry uses “rainflow counting” to extract cycle depths.  AI must approximate:  CycleEquivalent = sum(DoD_i extracted by rainflow)  Even if using simplified methods, AI must not double-count cycles.  9.3 Temperature-Dependent Cycle Life  Cycle life scales with temperature using Arrhenius factor:  CycleLife(T) = BaseLife * exp(−k*(T − T_ref))  9.4 SOC-Dependent Degradation  Leaving battery at high SOC increases degradation.  AI must reduce arbitrage cycles if SOC window is frequently full.  9.5 Accelerated Aging Scenarios  AI must detect hazard scenarios:  Repeated deep cycles  High daily cycles  Low-temperature charging  High-temperature operation  High C-rate operation  Long-term storage at high SOC  9.6 End-of-Life Definition  EoL occurs when usable capacity reaches 70–80% of initial.  AI must reduce economic benefits in late-life periods.  9.7 Mid-Life Replacement  If life < analysis horizon:  AI must apply:  ReplacementCost at year ReplacementYear  Discounted properly  Update new battery performance post-replacement  ------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — DEMAND RESPONSE TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT  ------------------------------------------------------------  10.1 DR Technical Requirements  Every DR program has unique technical constraints. Common parameters:  Power commitment (kW)  Event duration (hours)  Event count per year  Ramp time  Notification time  Refractory period between events  Recharge requirement  AI must enforce ALL constraints.  10.2 DR Event Energy Requirement  Required battery energy for event:  E_req = P_commit * H_event  AI must compare E_req to battery usable energy.  10.3 Recharge Feasibility  Batteries must recharge between events.  RechargeEnergy = E_req  RechargePower = ChargeLimit  AvailableTime = OffPeakHours  Recharge feasibility check:  RechargePower * AvailableTime >= RechargeEnergy  If false → DR participation is infeasible.  10.4 SOC Reservation Strategy  During DR windows, battery must maintain SOC high enough to satisfy event.  If DR event at time t:  SOC_min_required = E_req / E_usable  AI must enforce SOC >= this threshold anytime before t.\n\n10.5 DR + Peak Shaving Conflict  If DR event overlaps with facility peak:  Battery cannot perform both at full power.  AI must choose based on user’s priority goal.  10.6 DR + Arbitrage Conflict  If battery is dispatched for arbitrage overnight and fails to recharge in time:  DR eligibility fails.  AI must warn and modify dispatch algorithm.  10.7 Multi-Day DR Scenarios  If consecutive DR events occur, SOC behavior must be modeled across days.  10.8 Real-Time DR (Fast DR)  Fast DR programs require 1–5 minute ramp times.  Most C&I batteries cannot achieve this without inverter surge.  AI must mark such programs as “Not Eligible” unless battery supports high-speed discharge.  10.9 Frequency Response Constraints  Frequency response requires sub-second ramp:  Ramp < 0.5 seconds  Inverter must be grid-forming or grid-following with fast tracking  AI must treat frequency response as “Not Eligible” for normal BESS.  10.10 DR Dispatch pseudocode  If DR_event == true:  Discharge = min(P_commit, inverter limit, P_available_from_SOC)  SOC decreases accordingly  If SOC < required → DR violation → invalidate scenario  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 11 — BMS FIRMWARE CONSTRAINTS\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  11.1 Purpose of BMS  The BMS enforces safety, longevity, thermal protection, and charge control.  Even if the AI calculates theoretically possible behaviors, the BMS may override them.  11.2 BMS-Imposed Power Caps  BMS may limit power dynamically based on:  Temperature  SOC  Cell imbalance  Cycle count  Fault flags  AI must recheck battery power at each interval.  11.3 Temperature-Based BMS Derating  If T > T_thresh:  Battery power is reduced  If T > T_shutdown:  Battery shuts down  Typical shutdown at 60–70°C cell temp.  11.4 SOC Enforcement  BMS stops charging when SOC >= SOC_max  BMS stops discharging when SOC <= SOC_min  AI must reflect this behavior.  11.5 Fault Mode Behavior  On fault:  BMS opens contactor  Battery stops discharging and charging  AI must set battery power = 0  11.6 Communication Failures  If communication with EMS is lost:  Battery enters safe mode  AI must handle fallback behaviors (e.g., idle state)\n\n11.7 Balancing Behavior  When cells drift, balancing reduces charge rate or usable SOC.  AI must reduce charge acceptance near SOC ceiling.  11.8 Protection Algorithms  Overvoltage  Undervoltage  Overcurrent  Over-temperature  Under-temperature  Isolation fault  BMS shuts off battery.  AI must adopt conservative constraints reflecting BMS intervention.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 12 — INVERTER CONTROL & PCS FIRMWARE  ------------------------------------------------------------  12.1 PCS Control Loops  The power conversion system uses:  Current control loop  Voltage control loop  Phase-locked loop  Grid synchronization  AI must understand that inverter output is controlled, not free-running.  12.2 Inverter Ramp Rate  Inverters typically allow ramp rates:  dP/dt <= MaxRampRate\n\nExample: 10 kW per second  AI must respect ramp rate limits.  12.3 Grid Support Functions  Inverters may be required to:  Provide reactive power support  Ride through voltage dips  Follow volt-var curves  Limit power factor  AI must not violate grid-code constraints.  12.4 Inverter derating at high temperature  PCS temperature limits reduce AC power.  AI must derate output accordingly.  12.5 Voltage and Frequency Ride-Through  AI must enforce:  Under-voltage lockout  Over-voltage lockout  Over-frequency lockout  Under-frequency lockout  In these conditions, battery disconnects.  12.6 PCS Startup and Shutdown Times  PCS often requires 30–180 seconds to start or stop.  AI cannot assume instantaneous availability.  BATTERY TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS MANUAL  PART 3 — SAFETY, THERMAL RUNAWAY, UL9540A, NFPA 855  RAW STRUCTURED TEXT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 13 — THERMAL RUNAWAY MODELING AND PREVENTION  13.1 Purpose of Thermal Runaway Modeling  Thermal runaway represents the most severe catastrophic failure mode in lithium-ion battery systems. Any engineering, AI, or dispatch model must incorporate thermal constraints to prevent simulation of conditions that could theoretically trigger runaway events.  Thermal runaway cannot be “controlled” once initiated; prevention is the only acceptable strategy. The AI must therefore implement strict boundaries to ensure all modeled operating conditions remain safely within allowable thermal limits.  13.2 Root Causes of Thermal Runaway  Thermal runaway may originate from:  Internal short circuits  Mechanical penetration  Manufacturing defect  Lithium plating followed by dendrite formation  Overtemperature  Overvoltage  Overcurrent  External fire exposure  Poor ventilation causing trapped heat  Failure of cooling systems  Localized thermal gradients  AI must model and avoid all operational conditions that increase thermal runaway probability.  13.3 Exothermic Reaction Model  Thermal runaway begins when the rate of heat generated internally exceeds the rate at which the cooling system can remove heat.  Define:  Q_gen = heat generated internally  Q_dis = heat dissipated (cooling, convection, radiation)  Thermal runaway condition:  Q_gen > Q_dis\n\nInternal heat generation approximated by:  Q_gen = I^2 × R_internal + ExothermicChemicalHeat  At high temperatures, chemical heat generation increases exponentially.  AI must approximate:  If Temperature > Threshold_1 (typically 80°C) → elevated risk  If Temperature > Threshold_2 (typically 120°C) → runaway inevitable  13.4 Thermal Mass and Heat Capacity  Battery pack thermal characteristics defined by:  ΔT = Q_gen / (m × Cp)  Where:  m = mass of battery  Cp = specific heat capacity  AI must model rapid temperature rise at high current or low mass systems.  13.5 Hot Spot Formation  Cells do not heat uniformly. Localized hot spots cause early runaway.  AI modeling must be conservative and assume uniform temperature only for safety modeling.  If inadequate cooling or high C-rate is involved → derate power.  13.6 Cooling System Failure Logic  If cooling fails:  Q_dis = 0  Thus, runaway threshold is reached quicker.  AI must disable high-discharge or high-charge-rate models when cooling assumptions are unknown.  13.7 Early Detection Indicators  AI should model that early warning indicators include:  Cell voltage imbalance  Higher-than-expected internal resistance  Slow charge acceptance  Sudden temperature rise (>3°C per minute)  If any indicator predicted → AI must flag “Unsafe Operating Envelope”.  13.8 AI Guardrails for Thermal Runaway  AI must not:\n\nModel C-rate > manufacturer limit  Allow operation above 55°C sustained temperature  Allow charging below 0°C  Allow discharging beyond thermal envelope  Predict peak output for periods longer than thermal capacity  Ignore cooling limitations  Assume unlimited thermal dissipation  Any breach must produce a critical error.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 14 — UL9540A ENGINEERING ENVELOPE  ------------------------------------------------------------  14.1 Purpose of UL9540A  UL9540A is a destructive fire testing methodology that determines propagation risk in a battery energy storage system (BESS). AI must respect UL9540A findings implicitly because they define minimum fire separation, acceptable cabinet layouts, and containment requirements.  14.2 What UL9540A Tests Determine  Propagation behavior  Flaming and non-flaming failure modes  Gas release characteristics  Thermal runaway cascading potential  Maximum fire spread  Extinguishment feasibility  AI must treat UL9540A as hard safety boundaries.  14.3 Thermal Propagation Limits  AI must understand that UL9540A results determine if:  Modules require physical separation  Systems require firewalls\n\nSprinklers are required  HVAC requirements apply  14.4 Maximum Allowable Capacity per Unit  Many AHJs (Authorities Having Jurisdiction) impose limits such as:  600 kWh per fire zone  1 MWh per room  Container spacing rules  AI must never propose aggregated systems violating these limits.  14.5 Gas Venting Requirements  UL9540A dictates gas venting strategy.  AI must assume:  Closed-room installations require mechanical ventilation  Outdoor cabinets require exhaust clearance  14.6 Thermal Barriers  UL9540A results may specify minimum spacing between racks.  AI must assume:  Minimum 3 ft aisle spacing unless otherwise stated  Thermal padding for adjacent racks  14.7 AI Safety Rules  Do not propose battery placement without verifying UL9540A spacing.  Do not model cooling loads without confirming UL-based thermal output.  Do not treat battery cabinets as “zero propagation” unless certified.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 15 — NFPA 855 SITINGS, DISTANCE, AND BUILDING RULES  ------------------------------------------------------------  15.1 Purpose of NFPA 855  NFPA 855 governs installation of energy storage systems in buildings. AI modeling must incorporate code-driven constraints for battery placement, ventilation, fire suppression, and monitoring.\n\n15.2 Indoor ESS Installation Limits  AI must assume the following unless overridden by UL9540A-compliant certifications:  Maximum 600 kWh per fire zone  Dedicated ESS room with fire separation  Two-hour rated fire barrier  Fire suppression system (sprinkler or clean agent)  Dedicated ventilation pathway  No ESS in egress paths  15.3 Outdoor ESS Installation Rules  Outdoor units must maintain:  3–10 ft separation between cabinets  10–20 ft distance from building openings  Noncombustible pads  Weatherproof enclosures  15.4 Rooftop Installations  AI must enforce:  Structural engineering review  Wind load compliance  Clearance from mechanical intakes  Smoke venting considerations  15.5 Fire Detection Requirements  NFPA 855 requires:  Thermal detection  Smoke detection  Gas detection  Emergency shutoff  AI must assume these requirements apply to all systems.  15.6 Fire Suppression  ESS must have:  Automatic sprinkler or water-mist system  Thermal suppression agent  Manual override  AI must note that inadequate suppression reduces allowable battery size.  15.7 Monitoring & Emergency Functions  System must integrate with:\n\nFire alarm system  Remote monitoring  Emergency stop  First responders panel  AI must incorporate these into siting logic.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 16 — SAFETY DISTANCE, FIRE PROTECTION, AND LAYOUT MATH  ------------------------------------------------------------  16.1 Fire Zone Definition  A fire zone is a volume of space where a failing ESS could produce unacceptable thermal propagation.  AI must divide large installations into fire zones.  16.2 Maximum Energy per Fire Zone  Typical cap: 600 kWh  If system > 600 kWh → must be divided into zones.  16.3 Spacing Rule  If battery modules have non-zero propagation rating:  Minimum distance = D_prop  If modules certified as propagation-resistant:  Distance can be reduced.  AI must never assume propagation-resistance unless explicitly specified.  16.4 Heat Flux Modeling  Fire spacing is derived from radiant heat flux:  HeatFlux = k * (Temperature^4) / Distance^2  NFPA requires below threshold at adjacent cabinets.\n\n16.5 Wind and Venting  Outdoor ESS spacing is influenced by ventilation direction. AI must include:  Prevailing wind  Gas dispersion  Access paths for firefighters  16.6 Vertical Clearance  Heat plume rises. AI must enforce:  Minimum vertical clearance above cabinet  Avoidance of overhead hazards  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 17 — GRID-CODE, RIDE-THROUGH, AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY  ------------------------------------------------------------  17.1 Inverter Ride-Through Requirements  Per IEEE 1547, inverters must:  Ride through voltage dips  Ride through frequency excursions  Provide volt-var and freq-watt functions  AI must not simulate behavior violating ride-through capability.  17.2 Anti-Islanding Constraints  Inverters must disconnect during grid outages.  AI cannot model grid export during outage unless part of microgrid with UL-1741 SA certification.  17.3 Voltage Limits  AI must enforce:  V_min  V_max  If battery SOC correlates with voltage, AI must reduce discharge near voltage limits.\n\n17.4 Frequency Limits  AI must apply:  F_min  F_max  Under/over frequency lockout durations  17.5 Ground Fault Protection  If ground fault detected, inverter trips.  AI must set P=0 for fault duration.  17.6 Harmonic Distortion  Inverter must adhere to THD limits.  High discharge power can exceed THD → derating required.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 18 — RECHARGE, RECOVERY, AND CYCLING CONSTRAINTS  ------------------------------------------------------------  18.1 Recharge Time Calculation  RechargeTime = RequiredEnergy / ChargePower  AI must verify recharge fits within off-peak window.  18.2 Recovery Between DR Events  Some DR programs require minimum recovery periods.  Battery must return to baseline SOC before next event.  If:  ChargePower * AvailableTime < RequiredEnergy  Then:  DR eligibility fails.  18.3 Maximum Daily Cycles  For warranty:  Typical limit 1 cycle/day average  AI must penalize arbitrage that requires >1 cycle/day  AI must generate errors above 1.5 cycles/day sustained\n\n18.4 SOC Threshold Before Events  Battery must start arbitrage cycle only if:  SOC_max − SOC_min > EventSOCReserve  AI must enforce SOC guards.  18.5 Multi-Day Behavior  For 2–3 day DR heatwaves:  Battery must maintain consistent SOC reserves  Arbitrage cycles heavily reduced  Peak shaving may be compromised  AI must simulate multi-day intervals if DR included.  BATTERY TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS MANUAL  PART 3 (CONTINUED)  SYSTEM-LEVEL SAFETY, FAULT BEHAVIOR, GRID COMPLIANCE  RAW STRUCTURED TEXT  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 19 — SYSTEM-LEVEL THERMAL RUNAWAY MODELING  19.1 Multi-Module Propagation  In multi-module ESS configurations, a single cell failure may propagate thermally to adjacent cells or adjacent modules. AI must assume the worst-case unless UL9540A propagation tests state otherwise.\n\nPropagation risk is influenced by:  Cell spacing  Thermal barriers  Cooling system architecture  Module-to-module physical separation  Energy density per rack  Rack ventilation  AI must treat each module as a separate potential ignition source and evaluate the probability of cascading thermal failure.  19.2 Propagation Modeling  Let:  T_local = temperature of failing cell  T_adjacent = temperature of adjacent cell  ThermalCoupling = k * (T_local − T_adjacent)  Propagation is possible if:  T_adjacent exceeds its own runaway threshold after receiving thermal flux.  AI must assume:  High thermal coupling in tightly packed modules  Lower thermal coupling with fire-resistant materials  19.3 Worst-Case Gas Release  Thermal runaway releases:  Vent gases  Flammable electrolytes  Toxic compounds  Opaque smoke  The volume of gas G produced from a single cell failure is given approximately by:  G = m_cell * GasFactor  Where GasFactor typically equals 2–8 times the cell volume.  AI must assume gas release in enclosed spaces and incorporate ventilation as a constraint for indoor installations.  19.4 Pressure and Deflagration  ESS rooms require pressure-relief mechanisms to prevent structural damage. AI must recommend:  Mechanical exhaust fan sizing\n\nExplosion relief vents  Control of ignition sources  19.5 Firefighter Hazard Modeling  ESS must be considered a hazardous environment. AI must account for:  Firefighter access paths  Standby energy remaining in the system  Toxic gas release  Thermal hotspots  Risk of re-ignition  AI must avoid proposing installations without adequate emergency access.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 20 — ELECTRICAL FAULT BEHAVIOR  ------------------------------------------------------------  20.1 DC Fault Behavior  DC faults can include:  Short circuits  Ground faults  Arc faults  Overcurrent  Overvoltage  Connection failures  AI must assume all DC wiring must be modeled under NEC Article 706 and 690.  20.2 Short Circuit Modeling  Short circuit current approximated by:  I_sc = V_nominal / R_total  Where R_total includes internal resistance + line resistance.  AI must treat short-circuit current as extremely high and instantaneously damaging.\n\n20.3 Overcurrent Protection  Battery circuits require:  Fast-acting DC breakers  Fuses  Contactor systems  AI must model these devices as instantaneous event halters that disconnect the battery under fault.  20.4 AC Fault Behavior  On AC side, inverter offers overcurrent protection and anti-islanding.  AI must incorporate inverter AC fault trip logic:  Trip conditions triggered when:  I_AC > I_max  V_AC outside allowable range  Frequency outside allowable range  20.5 Arc Fault Behavior  Arc faults generate high heat and can induce ignition.  AI must ensure that DC cabling meets arc-fault detection requirements and GFDI protection.  20.6 Isolation Fault  If insulation resistance decreases below threshold, BMS trips.  AI must treat isolation fault as:  Battery offline  All power output zero  No DR or arbitrage possible  20.7 AI Guardrails  Under no circumstances may the AI propose:  Higher current than breaker rating  Operating conditions during faults  DR or arbitrage during fault states  Battery operation during anti-islanding lockout\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 21 — MICROGRID, BACKUP, AND ISLANDING CONSTRAINTS  ------------------------------------------------------------  21.1 Backup Power Envelope  Backup operation differs from arbitrage or DR because battery must operate during an outage in island mode. AI must incorporate:  Minimum backup SOC  Instantaneous switching capability  Load shedding logic  Duration of backup window  BackupSOC_min = RequiredBackupKWh / E_usable  21.2 Microgrid Islanding  If battery participates in microgrid islanding:  Inverter must be grid-forming  PV must be curtailed or controlled  Frequency and voltage regulation must be enforced  AI must never assume grid-forming capability unless explicitly stated.  21.3 Black Start Constraints  Black start capability means the battery can start the microgrid from zero power.  This requires:  Internal UPS mode  Soft start sequences  Regulated voltage output  AI must not assume this capability.  21.4 Load Prioritization  Backup operation requires:  Essential load identification  Load shedding curves  Critical load runtime guarantees  AI must compute runtime only for essential loads.\n\n21.5 Transfer Time Constraints  Critical loads require transfer times < 10 ms.  Typical BESS transfer times = 50–200 ms.  Thus, BESS cannot serve true UPS loads unless paired with UPS hardware.  AI must mark UPS requests as unsupported unless hybrid system specified.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 22 — LONG-TERM DEGRADATION FORECASTING  ------------------------------------------------------------  22.1 Five-Dimensional Degradation Model  Battery degradation depends on five dimensions:  Temperature  C-rate  DoD  SOC window  Cycle count  AI must track all of these simultaneously.  22.2 Degradation Equation  One standard form is:  Degradation_total = f_cal(T) + f_cycle(DoD, C-rate) + f_SOC(SOC_avg)  Where:  f_cal = calendar aging  f_cycle = cycle aging  f_SOC = high SOC stress  22.3 Calendar Aging Model  Calendar aging is temperature-driven:  k_cal = A * exp(−Ea / (R * T))  Total aging = k_cal * years  AI must reduce capacity annually.\n\n22.4 Cycle Aging Model  Cycle aging modeled as:  ΔCapacity_per_cycle = k_cycle * DoD^α  Where α from 1.1 to 1.4.  AI must count cycles using rainflow-equivalent cycles.  22.5 SOC Stress Model  High SOC increases oxidation:  Stress_SOC = k_SOC * (SOC_avg)^β  β typically around 0.5 to 1.0.  AI must penalize long time at > 90 percent SOC.  22.6 Degradation Distribution  AI must predict degradation as:  Capacity_year(t) = Capacity_initial * (1 − degradation_total(t))  Degraded capacity reduces effective arbitrage and peak shaving over time.  22.7 End-of-Life Determination  EOL threshold usually 70–80 percent capacity.  AI must estimate when battery crosses EOL and reduce available kWh accordingly.  22.8 Replacement Logic  If analysis horizon > lifetime:  Battery must be replaced  Replacement cost discounted  New battery resets degradation  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 23 — GRAY-AREA CONSTRAINTS AND SPECIAL CASES  ------------------------------------------------------------  23.1 Cold Weather Operation  Below freezing, lithium-ion cannot accept charge.\n\nAI must enforce:  Charge_power = 0 if T < 0°C  Reduced charge if 0 < T < 10°C  23.2 High Altitude Constraints  Air density decreases → cooling impaired  AI must derate battery power at high altitudes.  23.3 Partial Shaving  If peak is short spike < 15 minutes, battery may still shave it even with low duration. AI must use intelligent spike detection.  23.4 Multi-Interval Demand Charges  Some utilities use:  Fifteen-minute  Hourly  Daily peak windows  AI must adjust logic accordingly.  23.5 Solar-Integrated Constraints  If coupled with PV:  DC-coupled: battery charges from PV before grid  AC-coupled: limited by inverter  Hybrid: special constraints  AI must differentiate.  23.6 ITC (Investment Tax Credit) Eligibility  Charging must be mostly from renewable energy (75–100 percent depending on rules).  AI must enforce charging-source constraints.  23.7 Rapid Cycling  High-frequency cycling for grid services accelerates degradation. AI must disallow unless battery designed for high cycle count.  BATTERY TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS MANUAL\n\nPART 4 — AI GUARDRAILS, LOGIC, VALIDATION, MASTER EQUATIONS  RAW STRUCTURED TEXT  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 24 — AI SAFETY AND GUARDRAILS (ENGINEERING RULES)  24.1 Purpose of AI Guardrails  AI must never propose, estimate, calculate, or recommend any operation that is physically impossible, violates safety rules, violates warranty limits, or produces double-counted or fabricated savings.

If peak appears as single needle spike, AI must detect and apply smoothing.  If SOC insufficient for next event, AI must reduce arbitrage forecast.  If multiple DR events scheduled, AI must check recharge feasibility.  If user goal conflicts with constraints, AI must request clarification.  24.5 Goal Prioritization Guardrail  If battery cannot meet all priority tasks, AI must apply:  Priority = user-selected goal  THEN apply:  Peak shaving > arbitrage  DR > arbitrage  DR vs peak = depends on user goal  AI must expose trade-offs clearly.  24.6 No Hallucination Policy  AI must never:  Invent battery specs  Invent incentives  Invent tariff structures  Invent demand events  Invent manufacturer warranties  Invent system capabilities  AI may only:  Calculate  Simulate  Predict\n\nInfer from established rules  Request missing data  24.7 Conservatism Requirement  If uncertainty exists or data is missing:  AI must choose the conservative (safe, physically possible) interpretation.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 25 — AI TRAINING LOGIC FOR BATTERY MODELING  ------------------------------------------------------------  25.1 Purpose  This section defines how the AI should \"think\" about batteries at an expert-engineer level. It includes the complete mental model for:  Recognizing what data is required  Identifying missing details  Determining feasibility  Selecting measures  Running dispatch internally  Running constraint checks  Producing structured reasoning  25.2 The AI Battery Reasoning Loop  At every modeling request, AI must:  Step 1: Identify user goal  Step 2: Identify available data  Step 3: Fill missing data with industry-safe assumptions  Step 4: Build physical constraints envelope  Step 5: Run peak shaving model  Step 6: Run arbitrage model  Step 7: Run DR model  Step 8: Apply inverter, thermal, warranty constraints  Step 9: Compute financial metrics\n\nStep 10: Evaluate feasibility  Step 11: Compare multiple battery options  Step 12: Rank by user goal  Step 13: Generate explanation and caveats  25.3 How AI Should Handle Ambiguous Requests  If user says, “I want a battery sized correctly”, AI must ask:  What is the primary goal?  Demand reduction?  Arbitrage?  DR participation?  Incentive qualification?  Backup?  Mixed?  AI must not guess goal.  25.4 Training Set of Internal Heuristics  AI must internalize the following industry heuristics:  Heuristic 1: Commercial peaks last 45–120 minutes.  Heuristic 2: Most arbitrage occurs once per day.  Heuristic 3: Efficiency < 90% for discharge > 1C.  Heuristic 4: DR rarely pays more than $50–150 per kW-year.  Heuristic 5: If DoD > 80% daily, degradation becomes severe.  Heuristic 6: Battery lifetime = min(calendar, cycle).  Heuristic 7: Oversized batteries rarely increase ROI.

    "text": "Advanced Mathematical Architectures for Stochastic Energy Storage Optimization: Bridging Differentiable Programming, Probabilistic Forecasting, and Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning  1. Introduction: The Stochastic Control Challenge of Demand Charge Management  The modern electrical grid is undergoing a fundamental transformation characterized by the rapid integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) and the electrification of large-scale loads such as electric vehicle fleets and industrial heat pumps. In this dynamic landscape, the optimization of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) has transcended simple arbitrage strategies—buying low and selling high—to encompass complex ancillary services and, most critically, peak shaving. 1   Peak shaving, the reduction of grid demand during intervals of maximum consumption, is driven economically by demand charges: tariffs where utility customers are billed not just for the volume of energy consumed (kWh) but for the maximum rate of consumption (kW) recorded over a billing period, typically a month. 3  From a mathematical perspective, demand charge management represents a uniquely challenging stochastic control problem. Unlike energy arbitrage, which relies on additive cost functions over time, the demand charge introduces a non-additive, non-convex $\\max(\\cdot)$ operator over the entire decision horizon. The cost function $J$ is generally formulated as:  $$ J = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} c_t^{energy} P_t^{grid} \\Delta t + c^{demand} \\max_{t \\in {1, \\dots, T}} (P_t^{grid}) $$  This structure implies that a single suboptimal decision at any timestep $t$—specifically, a failure to discharge the battery during the true peak—can irrevocably determine the cost for the entire month, rendering all other optimal decisions moot.3 Furthermore, this operator is non-differentiable in the classical sense, complicating the application of gradient-based\n\noptimization methods common in modern machine learning.  Compounding this structural difficulty is the stochastic nature of the inputs. The load $P_t^{load}$ is a non-stationary time series subject to human behavior, industrial schedules, and weather conditions. Traditional \"Predict-then-Optimize\" frameworks, which first forecast the load using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and then optimize the battery schedule, fail to capture the asymmetric risk profile of this problem. 7   Under-predicting a peak is catastrophically expensive, while over-predicting incurs only minor efficiency losses. Therefore, a robust model requires a paradigm shift towards advanced mathematical architectures that can handle:  1.   High-Dimensional Probabilistic Forecasting:   Moving beyond point estimates to model full conditional distributions and long-range dependencies, utilizing architectures like the Informer with $O(L \\log L)$ complexity. 9  2.   End-to-End Differentiable Optimization:   Embedding the optimization problem itself as a layer within the neural network (e.g., CvxPyLayers), allowing gradients to backpropagate through the KKT conditions of the physical constraints. 10  3.   Distributional and Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL):   Replacing expected-value maximization with the optimization of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) via Distributional RL methods like Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN), and addressing sparse rewards through rigorous Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS). 11  This report provides an exhaustive mathematical analysis of these architectures, detailing the derivations, theoretical justifications, and integrative mechanisms required to build a state-of-the-art peak shaving model.  2. Physics and Economics of the BESS Environment  To construct a high-fidelity machine learning model, one must first rigorously define the physical and economic environment governing the BESS. The mathematical formulation of the state transitions and cost surfaces defines the manifold on which the learning algorithms must operate.  2.1 Battery State Dynamics and Efficiency Models  The evolution of the battery's energy state, $E_t$, is a discrete-time dynamical system. While simplified models assume constant efficiency, a high-performance model must account for the non-linear losses associated with electrochemical conversion.  Let $P_t^{batt}$ be the power flow at the battery terminals at time $t$, where $P_t^{batt} > 0$\n\ndenotes discharging (injecting power to the building/grid) and $P_t^{batt} < 0$ denotes charging. The net power drawn from the grid, $P_t^{grid}$, is given by the power balance equation:  $$P_t^{grid} = P_t^{load} - P_t^{batt}$$  Ideally, we constrain $P_t^{grid} \\le P_{limit}$, but in the demand charge context, $P_{limit}$ is a decision variable (the target peak) rather than a hard physical constraint.3  The state of charge (SoC) update equation incorporates charging efficiency $\\eta_{ch} \\in (0, 1]$ and discharging efficiency $\\eta_{dis} \\in (0, 1]$:  $$ E_{t+1} = E_t - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\eta_{dis}} \\cdot [P_t^{batt}]^+ - \\eta_{ch} \\cdot [P_t^{batt}]^- \\right) \\Delta t $$  where $[x]^+ = \\max(0, x)$ and $[x]^- = \\max(0, -x)$.  This piecewise linear formulation introduces a non-smoothness at $P_t^{batt} = 0$. In convex optimization contexts, this is typically handled by splitting $P_t^{batt}$ into two non-negative variables, $P_t^{dis}$ and $P_t^{ch}$, such that $P_t^{batt} = P_t^{dis} - P_t^{ch}$. To prevent simultaneous charging and discharging (which is physically impossible but mathematically feasible in relaxed linear programs), one often introduces binary variables or relies on the cost structure to discourage waste. However, in a differentiable layer context, avoiding binary variables is crucial to maintain gradient flow. 14   The objective function naturally penalizes simultaneous flows because $\\eta_{ch} < 1$ and $\\eta_{dis} < 1$ imply that any circular flow dissipates energy, increasing the net cost.  Physical constraints define the feasible region $\\mathcal{C}$:  $$E_{min} \\le E_t \\le E_{max} \\quad \\forall t$$  $$0 \\le P_t^{ch} \\le P_{max}^{ch}$$  $$0 \\le P_t^{dis} \\le P_{max}^{dis}$$  2.2 The Non-Convexity of Demand Tariffs  The economic landscape is defined by the tariff structure. Industrial tariffs typically include:  1.   Time-of-Use (ToU) Energy Charges:   $c_t^{energy}$ varies by hour (e.g., on-peak, off-peak, super-off-peak).  2.   Demand Charges:   A high cost $c^{demand}$ applied to the maximum grid power drawn over the billing cycle $T$.  The demand charge term, $C_{DC} = c^{demand} \\max_{t \\in} P_t^{grid}$, creates a global\n\ndependency. The gradient of this term with respect to power at time $t$, $\\frac{\\partial C_{DC}}{\\partial P_t^{grid}}$, is zero for all $t$ except the set of timesteps where the maximum is achieved.  $$ \\frac{\\partial C_{DC}}{\\partial P_t^{grid}} = \\begin{cases} c^{demand} & \\text{if } P_t^{grid} = \\max_{\\tau} P_\\tau^{grid} \\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$  This \"sparse gradient\" problem makes direct gradient descent training difficult. If the model successfully lowers the current peak at $t_{peak}$, the gradient instantly shifts to a new $t'_{peak}$. This phenomenon, known as \"peak hopping,\" requires the optimization landscape to consider the joint distribution of all potential peaks, not just the current maximum.3  Furthermore, the billing period $T$ (one month) is significantly longer than the typical prediction horizon of standard load forecasters (24-48 hours). This necessitates a hierarchical or \"rolling horizon\" approach where short-term decisions are guided by long-term value functions or cost-to-go approximations derived from RL or advanced forecasting. 16  3. Advanced Probabilistic Forecasting: The Informer Architecture  To mitigate the risk of peak exceedance, the control model requires accurate probabilistic forecasts of future loads. Standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTMs struggle with the long sequences required to capture weekly or monthly periodicities ($L \\approx 720$ to $2000$ hourly steps). The Transformer architecture, while powerful in capturing long-range dependencies via self-attention, suffers from $O(L^2)$ computational and memory complexity. For peak shaving, where we must analyze weeks of history to predict extreme events, this quadratic scaling is prohibitive.  The   Informer   architecture   9   solves this via the   ProbSparse Self-Attention   mechanism, achieving $O(L \\log L)$ complexity. We will now rigorously derive the mathematics behind this efficiency and its relevance to building the peak shaving model.  3.1 Mathematical Derivation of ProbSparse Attention  The standard self-attention mechanism computes a score between a query $Q$, key $K$, and value $V$:  $$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)V$$\n\nLet $q_i$ be the $i$-th row of $Q$, $k_j$ the $j$-th row of $K$, and $v_j$ the $j$-th row of $V$. The attention weight $A(q_i, K)$ defines a probability distribution $p(k_j | q_i)$ over the keys:  $$p(k_j | q_i) = \\frac{\\exp(q_i k_j^T / \\sqrt{d})}{\\sum_{l} \\exp(q_i k_l^T / \\sqrt{d})}$$  The Sparsity Hypothesis:  Empirical observation in time-series data suggests that the distribution of attention scores is long-tailed. For many queries, the dot products $q_i k_j^T$ result in a near-uniform probability distribution over keys. A uniform attention distribution, $q(k_j | q_i) = 1/L_K$, essentially computes a mean of the value vectors $V$, providing no specific local information. These are termed \"lazy\" queries. Conversely, \"active\" queries have a sharp, peaked distribution, focusing heavily on specific keys (e.g., historical peak events similar to the current context).19  To optimize efficiency, we should only compute the expensive dot products for \"active\" queries. We identify these by measuring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between the query's attention distribution $p$ and the uniform distribution $q$:  $$ KL(q_i |  | U) = \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} p(k_j | q_i) \\ln \\frac{p(k_j | q_i)}{1/L_K} $$  $$ KL(q_i |  | U) = \\ln L_K + \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} p(k_j | q_i) \\ln p(k_j | q_i) $$  Since explicitly computing $p(k_j | q_i)$ requires the $O(L)$ summation we wish to avoid, the Informer uses an approximation based on the Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) inequality. The sparsity measurement $M(q_i, K)$ is defined as:  $$ M(q_i, K) = \\ln \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{L_K} \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} \\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}} $$  This measurement represents the difference between the LSE of the unnormalized attention scores and their arithmetic mean. 21   If this difference is large, the distribution is peaked (active). If small, it is uniform (lazy).  Sampling Approximation:  To avoid iterating over all $j$, the Informer randomly samples a subset of keys $U_{sample}$ of size $c \\cdot \\ln L_K$. The measurement is approximated as:  $$ \\bar{M}(q_i, K) = \\max_{k_j \\in U_{sample}} \\left(\\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{L_K} \\sum_{k_j \\in U_{sample}} \\left(\\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) $$  Using this metric, we select the top-$u$ queries (where $u = c \\cdot \\ln L_Q$). We compute the full cross-attention only for these $u$ queries. For the remaining $L_Q - u$ queries, we simply assign the mean of the value vectors $V$. This reduces the complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L \\log L)$, allowing the model to process significantly longer history windows (e.g., 2 weeks at 15-minute resolution = 1344 points) to identify recurring peak patterns.9  3.2 Self-Attention Distilling and Generative Decoding\n\nFor peak shaving, we need to predict a sequence of future loads (e.g., the next 24 hours). The Informer employs a   Generative Style Decoder   to output the entire sequence in a single forward pass, unlike the step-by-step autoregressive decoding of standard Transformers which accumulates error.  Furthermore, to handle the hierarchy of temporal features (from weekly trends down to hourly spikes), the encoder uses Self-Attention Distilling. Between attention blocks, a convolutional layer with max-pooling reduces the sequence length:  $$X_{j+1} = \\text{MaxPool}(\\text{ELU}(\\text{Conv1d}(X_j)))$$  This operation halves the dimension $L$ at each layer, constructing a pyramid of features. Mathematically, this enforces that higher layers in the network attend to coarser-grained, dominant features (like daily baselines), while lower layers attend to fine-grained details (like instantaneous power spikes). This multi-scale representation is critical for separating the \"base load\" from the \"peak load\" components of the demand.19  3.3 Pinball Loss for Probabilistic Output  Standard regression minimizes Mean Squared Error (MSE), which estimates the conditional mean $\\mathbb{E}[y|x]$. However, for risk-sensitive control, we need the conditional quantiles (e.g., the 90th percentile $q_{0.9}$). We employ the   Pinball Loss   (or Quantile Loss). 24  For a quantile $\\tau \\in (0, 1)$, the loss is:  $$L_\\tau(y, \\hat{y}) = \\max(\\tau(y - \\hat{y}), (\\tau - 1)(y - \\hat{y}))$$  Gradient Analysis:  The gradient of the Pinball loss with respect to the prediction $\\hat{y}$ is:  $$ \\frac{\\partial L_\\tau}{\\partial \\hat{y}} = \\begin{cases} -\\tau & \\text{if } y > \\hat{y} \\ 1 - \\tau & \\text{if } y \\le \\hat{y} \\end{cases} $$  This gradient is constant but asymmetric. If $\\tau = 0.95$ (modeling the upper tail of demand), under-prediction ($y > \\hat{y}$) generates a gradient of magnitude $0.95$, while over-prediction generates a gradient of $0.05$. This forces the neural network to prioritize upper-bound accuracy heavily. By training on a composite loss $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} L_\\tau$, where $\\mathcal{T} = \\{0.1, 0.5, 0.9\\}$, the Informer outputs a full probabilistic cone of future demand, enabling the optimization layer to make risk-aware decisions.26  4. End-to-End Differentiable Optimization Layers\n\nThe classical \"Predict-then-Optimize\" pipeline decouples the forecasting model from the decision model. The forecaster minimizes Pinball loss, and the optimizer minimizes cost given the forecast. This is suboptimal because the \"cost of error\" is not uniform; an error in forecasting a non-peak hour has zero economic impact, while an error at a peak hour has massive impact.  To align these objectives, we utilize   Differentiable Convex Optimization Layers   (such as CvxPyLayers or OptNet). This allows us to embed the battery dispatch optimization   inside   the neural network, permitting backpropagation from the final electricity bill directly to the forecasting weights. 10  4.1 Canonicalization and the KKT Conditions  We formulate the daily battery dispatch as a convex optimization problem parameterized by the forecast $\\hat{y}$ (output of the Informer). Let $z$ be the decision variables (battery power $P^{batt}$, state of energy $E$).  $$\\min_z f(z; \\theta) \\quad \\text{s.t. } Gz \\le h, Az = b$$  Here, $\\theta$ represents the parameters provided by the neural network (e.g., the forecasted load vector $\\hat{P}^{load}$). The layer outputs the optimal schedule $z^*(\\theta)$.  To compute the gradient $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta}$ (where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the final cost), we need the Jacobian $\\frac{\\partial z^*}{\\partial \\theta}$. We derive this by differentiating the   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)   optimality conditions.  The KKT conditions for the problem are:  1.   Primal Feasibility:   $Az^* - b = 0, \\quad Gz^* - h \\le 0$  2.   Dual Feasibility:   $\\lambda^* \\ge 0$  3.   Stationarity:   $\\nabla_z f(z^*) + A^T \\nu^* + G^T \\lambda^* = 0$  4.   Complementary Slackness:   $\\text{diag}(\\lambda^*) (Gz^* - h) = 0$  Let $\\mathcal{R}(z, \\lambda, \\nu, \\theta) = 0$ be the system of equations representing these conditions. By the Implicit Function Theorem, the total differential is zero:  $$ \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{R} + \\nabla_{(z, \\lambda, \\nu)} \\mathcal{R} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial (z, \\lambda, \\nu)}{\\partial \\theta} = 0 $$  Thus, the Jacobian of the solution is:  $$ \\frac{\\partial (z^, \\lambda^, \\nu^*)}{\\partial \\theta} = - \\left( \\nabla_{(z, \\lambda, \\nu)} \\mathcal{R} \\right)^{-1} \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{R} $$  The matrix $\\nabla_{(z, \\lambda, \\nu)} \\mathcal{R}$ is the KKT matrix. For a quadratic program\n\n(QP), this matrix takes the form:  $$K = \\begin{bmatrix} Q & G^T & A^T \\\\ D(\\lambda^*)G & D(Gz^* - h) & 0 \\\\ A & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$  where $D(\\cdot)$ denotes a diagonal matrix.  4.2 Handling Active Constraints and Matrix Singularity  In battery optimization, constraints such as $E_{min} \\le E_t \\le E_{max}$ are frequently active (the battery is full or empty). The complementary slackness condition introduces non-differentiability when a constraint switches from active to inactive. CvxPyLayers handles this by smoothing the KKT conditions or by formulating the backward pass using the  homogeneous self-dual embedding . 10  A critical implementation detail is ensuring the KKT matrix $K$ is non-singular. In cases where the problem is degenerate (e.g., multiple optimal solutions), $K$ is not invertible. To mitigate this, we add a small regularization term $\\epsilon \\|z\\|_2^2$ to the objective function, making the problem strictly convex and the KKT matrix non-singular. This ensures stable gradient flow even when the battery is idle. 29  4.3 Integrating with the Peak Shaving Loss  With the Jacobian $\\frac{\\partial z^*}{\\partial \\hat{y}}$ available, we define the loss function as the actual cost of the schedule $z^*$ against the true load $y_{true}$:  $$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\text{Cost}(z^*(\\hat{y}(\\theta)), y_{true})$$  $$ \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\partial \\text{Cost}}{\\partial z^} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^}{\\partial \\hat{y}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial \\theta} $$  This gradient chain has a profound physical interpretation. The term $\\frac{\\partial z^*}{\\partial \\hat{y}}$ quantifies the   sensitivity of the battery schedule to the forecast .  ●   If the battery is constrained (e.g., fully charged) and cannot react to a change in forecast, the sensitivity is zero, and the gradient vanishes.  ●   If the battery is actively shaving a peak, the sensitivity is high.  ●   Critically, this mechanism automatically weights the forecasting loss. Errors in the forecast\n\nthat do not change the optimal dispatch (e.g., errors during off-peak times where the battery is idle) receive zero weight. Errors during peak times that alter the dispatch receive high weight. This effectively learns a \"task-based loss function\" without manual engineering. 7  5. Distributional Reinforcement Learning  While differentiable optimization is powerful for planning over short, deterministic horizons, it struggles with the inherent stochasticity of the month-long demand charge problem. The \"true\" peak might occur 20 days from now, beyond the horizon of a daily optimizer. Reinforcement Learning (RL) maps states to actions $(s \\to a)$ to maximize long-term cumulative reward, making it suitable for this infinite-horizon control.  However, standard RL (like DQN or PPO) estimates the   expected   return $Q(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}$. For peak shaving, the expected return is insufficient because the cost is driven by   tail risks   (rare, extreme load events). A policy that maximizes expected return might be risky, accepting a 5% chance of a massive peak to save small amounts of energy daily. We need a risk-averse policy, which requires   Distributional RL . 11  5.1 The Distributional Bellman Operator  In Distributional RL, we model the full distribution of returns $Z(s,a)$ rather than just its mean. The scalar Bellman equation is replaced by a distributional one:  $$Z(s,a) \\overset{D}{=} R(s,a) + \\gamma Z(s', a')$$  where $\\overset{D}{=}$ denotes equality in distribution. $Z$ is a random variable.  To implement this, we use   Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) . 33   We approximate the distribution $Z(s,a)$ using a discrete set of $N$ quantiles, supported at cumulative probabilities $\\tau_i = \\frac{i - 0.5}{N}$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$. The network outputs a vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(s,a) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$, where $\\theta_i$ estimates the value of the $\\tau_i$-th quantile.  5.2 Wasserstein Distance and Quantile Loss\n\nUnlike Categorical DQN (C51) which minimizes KL divergence between categorical distributions, QR-DQN minimizes the   1-Wasserstein distance   between the predicted distribution and the target distribution. The Wasserstein metric is crucial here because it is a true metric on probability distributions and provides meaningful gradients even when the supports of the distributions are disjoint (which is common in deterministic reward environments like battery control). 35  The loss function for QR-DQN is the Huber Quantile Loss averaged over all pairs of predicted quantiles $\\theta_i$ and target quantiles $\\theta_j'$:  $$ \\mathcal{L}{QR} = \\sum{i=1}^N \\mathbb{E}{s,a,r,s'} \\left[ \\sum{j=1}^N \\rho_{\\tau_i}^\\kappa (r + \\gamma \\theta_j(s', a^*) - \\theta_i(s,a)) \\right]  $$where $\\rho_{\\tau}^\\kappa(u)$ is the Huber loss variants for quantiles:$$  \\rho_{\\tau}^\\kappa(u) = | \\tau - \\mathbb{I}{{u < 0}} | \\frac{\\mathcal{L}\\kappa(u)}{\\kappa} $$  and $\\mathcal{L}_\\kappa$ is the standard Huber loss.  5.3 Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN)  An advancement over QR-DQN is Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN). Instead of fixed quantiles $\\tau_i$, IQN takes $\\tau$ as an input to the network (sampled from a base distribution, e.g., $U$) and outputs the corresponding quantile value $Z_\\tau(s,a)$.  $$Z_\\tau(s,a) \\approx f(\\psi(s), \\phi(\\tau))$$  where $\\phi(\\tau)$ is an embedding of the probability $\\tau$. This allows the network to query any part of the return distribution distribution, providing infinite resolution. For peak shaving, this is valuable as it allows us to focus arbitrarily closely on the extreme tails ($\\tau \\to 1$) where the demand charge risks lie.12  6. Risk-Sensitive Control via CVaR Optimization  Having access to the return distribution $Z(s,a)$ enables us to construct policies that explicitly minimize tail risk. The most appropriate risk measure for peak shaving is   Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)   (also known as Expected Shortfall).  6.1 CVaR Formulation\n\nFor a random cost variable $C$ (or negative return $-Z$) and confidence level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ (e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$), the Value at Risk ($VaR_\\alpha$) is:  $$VaR_\\alpha(C) = \\inf \\{ c : P(C \\le c) \\ge \\alpha \\}$$  The $CVaR_\\alpha$ is the expected cost given that the cost exceeds the VaR:  $$CVaR_\\alpha(C) = \\mathbb{E}$$  In the context of Distributional RL, where $Z$ represents returns (higher is better), we are interested in the lower tail (worst outcomes). The lower-tail CVaR at level $\\alpha$ is:  $$CVaR_\\alpha(Z) = \\mathbb{E}[Z | Z \\le F_Z^{-1}(\\alpha)]$$  6.2 Risk-Sensitive Policy Update  With QR-DQN, we have explicit estimates of the quantiles $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_N$. Since $\\tau_i$ are uniformly spaced, the $\\alpha$-CVaR can be approximated by averaging the lowest $k = \\lfloor \\alpha N \\rfloor$ quantiles. 34  The risk-sensitive policy $\\pi_{CVaR}$ selects actions to maximize this lower-tail average, effectively ignoring the optimistic upper tail:  $$a^*_{CVaR} = \\text{argmax}_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\alpha N \\rfloor} \\theta_i(s,a)$$  This mathematical modification transforms the agent. A standard agent ($\\alpha=1$) maximizes the mean. A risk-averse agent ($\\alpha=0.1$) maximizes the worst-case 10% of outcomes.  Insight: In peak shaving, this means the agent will discharge the battery even if the probability of a peak is only 10%. It hedges against the \"worst-case scenario\" that the load might spike, ensuring the demand charge is minimized even in unlikely weather events. This robustness is mathematically guaranteed by the CVaR objective.37  6.3 Policy Gradient Theorem for CVaR  For continuous control (where action space is continuous power $P^{batt}$), we cannot simply\n\niterate over discrete actions. We must use policy gradient methods. The gradient of the CVaR objective requires careful derivation.  Using the dual representation of CVaR:  $$CVaR_\\alpha(Z) = \\max_{\\nu} \\left( \\nu - \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\mathbb{E}[( \\nu - Z )^+] \\right)$$  Tamar et al. 39 derived the gradient of CVaR with respect to policy parameters $\\theta$:  $$\\nabla_\\theta J_{CVaR}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\mathbb{E}_{s,a \\sim \\pi_\\theta} \\left$$  where $\\nu^*$ is the optimal VaR value.  Interpretation:   The indicator function $\\mathbb{I}_{\\{R \\le \\nu^*\\}}$ acts as a filter. The gradient is computed   only   using trajectories that resulted in returns worse than the VaR threshold. This focuses the learning entirely on the \"failure cases\" (months where peaks were not successfully shaved), ensuring the neural network updates its weights to specifically prevent these catastrophic outliers. This is mathematically distinct from standard Policy Gradient (REINFORCE), which averages over all trajectories. 41  7. Addressing Sparse Rewards: Potential-Based Reward Shaping  A fundamental difficulty in RL for demand charges is the reward sparsity. The agent receives feedback on the demand charge only at the end of the month (step $T \\approx 720$). For the preceding 719 steps, the demand charge reward is zero. This \"temporal credit assignment\" problem makes convergence usually slow or impossible. 42  To solve this, we employ   Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) . We construct a shaping function $F(s,s')$ that provides immediate feedback while mathematically guaranteeing that the optimal policy is unchanged.  7.1 PBRS Theorem and Policy Invariance  According to Ng et al. 43, if the shaping reward is of the form:  $$F(s, s') = \\gamma \\Phi(s') - \\Phi(s)$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is any real-valued function of state, then the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ for the shaped MDP is identical to the optimal policy for the original MDP. This is a rigorous sufficiency condition.  7.2 Deriving the Demand Charge Potential  We need a potential function $\\Phi(s)$ that captures the \"loom\" of the demand charge. Let the state $s_t$ include the variable $p_t^{max}$, representing the maximum peak recorded so far in the current billing cycle:  $$p_t^{max} = \\max(P_1^{grid}, \\dots, P_t^{grid})$$  The final demand charge cost is $C_{DC} = \\mu_d \\cdot p_T^{max}$. This suggests the potential function should be related to the negative of the current accumulated peak cost:  $$\\Phi(s_t) = - \\mu_d \\cdot p_t^{max}$$  Substituting this into the PBRS equation:  $$F(s_t, s_{t+1}) = \\gamma (-\\mu_d p_{t+1}^{max}) - (-\\mu_d p_t^{max})$$  $$F(s_t, s_{t+1}) = \\mu_d (p_t^{max} - \\gamma p_{t+1}^{max})$$  Assuming $\\gamma \\approx 1$ for the shaping intuition:  $$F(s_t, s_{t+1}) \\approx -\\mu_d (p_{t+1}^{max} - p_t^{max})$$  Mathematical Implication:  ●   If $P_{t+1}^{grid} \\le p_t^{max}$, then $p_{t+1}^{max} = p_t^{max}$, and $F \\approx 0$.  ●   If $P_{t+1}^{grid} > p_t^{max}$, then $p_{t+1}^{max} > p_t^{max}$, and $F < 0$. Specifically, $F = -\\mu_d (P_{t+1}^{grid} - p_t^{max})$.  This transformation converts the sparse monthly penalty into a dense, immediate penalty. Every time the agent allows the grid power to exceed the current month's historical maximum, it receives an instantaneous penalty proportional to the   increment   of the new peak. This provides a dense gradient signal at every step where a new peak is established, allowing the value function to converge rapidly while mathematically preserving the global optimality of the monthly minimization objective. 6\n\n8. Integrated Architecture: The End-to-End Relearning Framework  To synthesize these components into a unified model, we propose a   Bi-Level End-to-End Relearning Framework . 46  8.1 Architecture Diagram  1.   Outer Loop (Policy Learning):   A Risk-Sensitive Distributional RL agent (QR-DQN) determines the high-level strategy (e.g., target SoC or marginal price threshold) to manage long-term risk and monthly demand charges.  2.   Inner Loop (Differentiable Control):   A CvxPyLayer solves the short-term (24h) constrained optimization problem given the RL agent's strategic parameters and the Informer's probabilistic forecasts.  3.   Forecaster:   The Informer network provides quantile forecasts $\\hat{Y} = [\\hat{y}_{0.1}, \\hat{y}_{0.5}, \\hat{y}_{0.9}]$.  Data Flow:  $$ \\text{State } s_t \\xrightarrow{Informer} \\hat{Y}_t \\xrightarrow{QR-DQN} \\text{Strategy } \\theta_t \\xrightarrow{CvxPyLayer} \\text{Action } P_t^{batt} $$  8.2 Joint Optimization Objective  The entire pipeline is differentiable. We can define a joint loss function:  $$ \\mathcal{L}{total} = \\lambda_1 \\mathcal{L}{Pinball}(\\hat{Y}, Y_{true}) + \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{L}{CVaR}(P^{batt}, C{DC}) + \\lambda_3 \\mathcal{L}_{Reg} $$  Gradients backpropagate from the CVaR cost through the CvxPyLayer (via KKT implicit differentiation) to the QR-DQN and Informer weights simultaneously. This ensures that the forecaster learns features relevant to control (features that minimize CVaR) rather than just minimizing RMSE. 46  8.3 Handling Non-Stationarity\n\nGrid environments are non-stationary (NS-MDP). Seasonality and degrading battery health change the transition dynamics $P(s'|s,a)$. The framework includes a   Relearning Trigger . We monitor the distribution of prediction errors. If the KL divergence between the recent error distribution and the training error distribution exceeds a threshold $\\delta$, the model triggers an online update, fine-tuning the weights on the most recent window of experience. This ensures the model adapts to seasonal shifts or battery aging effects. 46  9. Conclusion  The optimization of energy storage for peak shaving is a problem that defies simple heuristic or standard supervised learning solutions due to the specific mathematical properties of the demand charge: global temporal dependency, non-convexity of the max operator, and the extreme asymmetry of risk.  To build a robust model, one must implement a stack of advanced mathematical architectures:  1.   Forecasting:   Informer   with   ProbSparse Attention   ($O(L \\log L)$) and   Pinball Loss   to capture the conditional distribution of long-sequence load data.  2.   Optimization:   Differentiable Convex Layers   (CvxPyLayers) to allow end-to-end gradient flow through the physical constraints of the battery.  3.   Control:   Distributional RL (QR-DQN)   to model the full return distribution and optimize  CVaR , ensuring robustness against tail risks.  4.   Reward Shaping:   Potential-Based Reward Shaping   with the potential $\\Phi(s) = -\\mu p_{max}$ to rigorously solve the sparse reward problem while maintaining policy invariance.  This integrated approach moves beyond \"black-box\" AI, leveraging domain-specific mathematical structures to solve the unique challenges of the stochastic energy grid.  10.

    "text": "Optimal Control Architectures for Battery-Based Peak Demand Management: A Comprehensive Technical Report  Executive Summary  The transition of energy storage systems (BESS) from passive assets to active, intelligent grid resources necessitates a fundamental shift in control logic. The specific operational failure identified—an AI model that discharges continuously (\"shaves all day\") rather than targeting specific high-value intervals—indicates a misalignment between the control algorithm’s objective function and the stochastic, scarcity-driven nature of peak demand management. In the domain of commercial and industrial (C&I) energy management, energy (kWh) is a finite resource that must be surgically deployed to reduce power capacity (kW). A strategy that flattens \"broad hills\" of load rather than \"needle peaks\" dissipates stored energy on intervals that carry zero marginal economic value, rendering the system incapable of mitigating the true monthly maximum demand.  This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the data architectures, mathematical formulations, and control strategies required to rectify this failure. It moves beyond simple heuristic thresholding to explore rigorous optimization frameworks—specifically Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for deterministic planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for stochastic control. By integrating specific input datasets (electricity rates, battery physics, interval load data), we define a \"Peak-Aware\" state space that enables the AI to quantify the opportunity cost of every discharged kilowatt-hour. The analysis demonstrates that effective peak shaving requires a system that learns to value the   preservation   of energy as highly as its  deployment , acting only when the probability of setting a new billing peak exceeds a dynamically calculated risk threshold.  1. The Physics and Economics of Peak Shaving\n\nTo engineer an AI capable of effective Demand Charge Management (DCM), one must first define the boundary conditions of the problem: the economic signals sent by the utility and the physical constraints imposed by the battery. The observed failure mode of continuous discharge suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of these boundary conditions within the current model's logic.  1.1 The Economic Objective: Capacity vs. Energy  The primary error in the current application is likely the conflation of energy arbitrage with demand charge management.  ●   Energy Arbitrage   creates value by exploiting the differential in energy prices ($\\$/kWh$) over time. Since prices often follow a diurnal curve (low at night, high during the day), an arbitrage-focused algorithm   will   discharge continuously throughout the on-peak window. 1  ●   Peak Shaving   creates value by reducing the maximum instantaneous power draw ($\\$/kW$) recorded over a billing cycle. This charge is typically determined by a single 15-minute or 30-minute interval. 3  Because the demand charge is determined by the   single highest   interval, reducing load in any other interval has   zero marginal value   for the capacity component of the bill. If a facility’s load profile has a \"needle peak\" of 500 kW at 2:00 PM and a \"broad hill\" of 400 kW from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, discharging at 10:00 AM reduces energy costs (arbitrage) but contributes nothing to demand reduction if the 2:00 PM peak is not also addressed. \"Shaving all day\" implies the AI is optimizing for energy volume rather than peak magnitude.  1.2 The \"Needle Peak\" vs. \"Broad Hill\" Topology  The shape of the customer's load profile dictates the requisite energy-to-power ratio (E/P ratio) of the BESS and the difficulty of the control problem.  ●   Needle Peaks:   Characterized by low load factors, these peaks are sharp and short-duration. A BESS can effectively shave these with minimal energy expenditure. This is the ideal scenario for high-ROI peak shaving. 4  ●   Broad Hills:   Characterized by high load factors (e.g., continuous industrial processes). Shaving these requires massive energy reserves. If the AI attempts to shave a broad hill with a battery sized for needle peaks, it will hit its minimum State of Charge (SoC) long before the high-load period ends. Once the battery is empty, the load returns to the grid\n\nlevel, setting a peak that negates all previous shaving efforts. 5  The AI must effectively perform   Load Duration Curve Analysis   in real-time. It must integrate the area under the curve above a candidate threshold $P_{target}$ to determine if the battery's energy capacity $E_{batt}$ is sufficient to sustain that threshold for the entire duration of the violation.  $$E_{required} = \\int_{t_{start}}^{t_{end}} \\max(0, P_{load}(t) - P_{target}) \\, dt$$  The condition for feasibility is $E_{required} \\leq E_{batt} \\cdot \\eta_{discharge}$. The current AI model likely lacks this integral check, leading it to attack a target it cannot sustain. 6  1.3 Rate Structures as Design Constraints  The \"library of electricity rates\" mentioned in the query contains the essential constraints for the optimization problem. These must be parsed into specific feature vectors for the AI.  Rate Component   Data Structure   Impact on Control Logic  Consumption Charge   Time-Series Vector ($/kWh)   Incentivizes arbitrage. Can  conflict with peak shaving if  high prices don't align with  peaks.  Demand Charge (NCP)   Scalar ($/kW)   The primary driver for  \"Peak-So-Far\" logic. Drives  the scarcity value of energy.  Ratchet Clause   Constraint ($P_{min}$)   A billing mechanism where  the billable peak is the  maximum of the current  month OR a percentage of  the annual peak (e.g., 80%  of summer max). 3   This sets  a hard floor; shaving below  this level yields   zero  savings .\n\nCoincident Peak (CP)   Stochastic Flag   A charge based on the  grid's   peak, not the  customer's. Requires  external grid forecasting  features.  The \"Shaving All Day\" error often arises when the optimizer over-weights the Consumption Charge (Arbitrage) relative to the Demand Charge, or fails to model the Ratchet Clause, attempting to shave below a \"sunk cost\" floor.  2. Advanced Data Engineering: Feeding the AI  The user query specifies that the system has access to \"customer interval data,\" \"batteries,\" and \"electricity rates.\" To fix the control logic, these raw inputs must be transformed into a sophisticated   State Space   that gives the AI situational awareness. The model cannot learn to conserve energy for a future peak if its input features do not explicitly quantify \"risk\" and \"future scarcity.\"  2.1 The \"Peak-Aware\" State Space Features  Standard time-series forecasting uses past load to predict future load. For peak shaving, the AI needs features that describe the   relationship   between the current load and the billing constraints. The following engineered features are mandatory. 7  2.1.1 The \"Peak-So-Far\" Vector  This is the single most critical feature for preventing unnecessary discharge.  ●   Peak_Observed_Month ($P_{max\\_observed}$):   The maximum demand recorded by the meter since the start of the current billing cycle.  ○   Calculation:   $P_{max\\_observed} = \\max(\\{P_{load}(\\tau) \\mid \\tau \\in [0, t]\\})$  ●   Headroom ($P_{headroom}$):   The distance between the current load and the observed peak.  ○   Calculation:   $P_{headroom}(t) = P_{load}(t) - P_{max\\_observed}$\n\n○   Signal Value:  ■   If $P_{headroom} > 0$: The facility is actively setting a new peak. The battery  must   discharge to defend the threshold.  ■   If $P_{headroom} < 0$: The current load is below the peak. Discharge provides   no demand charge savings . The AI should idle or charge, unless energy arbitrage ($/kWh) is extremely profitable.  ○   Insight:   In the current failing model, this feature is likely missing or ignored, causing the agent to see \"high load\" as a trigger to discharge, even if that \"high load\" is 50 kW below the peak set yesterday.  2.1.2 Temporal Scarcity Features  ●   Billing_Cycle_Progress:   A normalized scalar ($0 \\rightarrow 1$) indicating position in the billing month.  ○   Relevance:   Early in the month, setting a new peak is low-risk (there are 29 days left to set a higher one). Late in the month, setting a new peak is catastrophic (it locks in the charge). The AI should learn to be   risk-neutral   early and   risk-averse   late. 8  ●   Days_Remaining:   Integer count of days left. Used to calculate the \"option value\" of stored energy.  2.1.3 Cyclical Time Encoding  Raw timestamps (e.g., hour 0-23) introduce discontinuities. Cyclical encoding preserves temporal proximity. 10  ●   Hour_Sin / Hour_Cos:   $\\sin(2\\pi h/24)$, $\\cos(2\\pi h/24)$.  ●   Month_Sin / Month_Cos:   Captures seasonal variations in HVAC load (cooling degree days).  2.2 Battery State and Physics Features  The \"batteries with their sizing and cost\" data must be converted into dynamic state variables.  ●   SoC (State of Charge):   Current energy level (normalized $0 \\rightarrow 1$).  ●   SoH (State of Health):   A derating factor (e.g., 0.92) representing capacity fade. The AI must know that 100% SoC today represents fewer kWh than it did last year. 11\n\n●   C_Rate_Limit:   The maximum power the battery can inject at this specific moment. This is non-linear; as SoC drops below 10-20% or temperature drops, the BMS (Battery Management System) throttles power output. If the AI expects 100kW but gets 50kW, the peak shaving fails.  2.3 Solar PV and Net Load Integration  If the customer has onsite generation, the relevant variable is Net Load.  $$P_{net}(t) = P_{load}(t) - P_{PV}(t)$$  The AI must ingest Solar Irradiance Forecasts (GHI/DNI) to predict the Net Load.  ●   Clear_Sky_Index:   A ratio of actual irradiance to theoretical clear-sky irradiance. This helps the AI distinguish between \"nighttime\" (predictable zero) and \"cloud cover\" (stochastic drop). High intermittency requires a higher reserve buffer in the battery. 12  2.4 Data Preprocessing and Cleansing  Raw interval data is rarely model-ready.  ●   Resampling:   If the meter data is 5-minute but the demand charge is 15-minute, the data must be resampled (averaged) to 15 minutes. Optimizing at 5-minute resolution for a 15-minute charge leads to \"over-shaving\" (wasting energy on short spikes that would naturally average out). 14  ●   Imputation:   Missing intervals should be filled via linear interpolation (for short gaps) or \"same-day-last-week\" substitution (for long gaps) to prevent the AI from interpreting a data outage as a \"zero load\" opportunity to charge.  3. Forecasting Modules: The Eyes of the System  To stop \"shaving all day,\" the system needs to anticipate the   magnitude   and   timing   of the day's peak relative to the rest of the month. This requires a hierarchical forecasting architecture.\n\n3.1 Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF)  This module predicts the load profile for the next $H$ hours (Rolling Horizon).  ●   Architecture:   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)   networks are the industry standard for time-series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies (e.g., the thermal inertia of a building). 15  ●   Target Variable:   Net Load ($kW$) at 15-minute resolution.  ●   Input Window:   Past 24-168 hours of load, temperature, and day-type.  ●   Loss Function:   The model should prioritize   Peak Magnitude Accuracy   over general Mean Squared Error (MSE). A standard MSE loss treats an error at 3 AM (low load) the same as an error at 3 PM (peak load).  ○   Custom Loss:   Weighted MSE where weights are proportional to the load magnitude: $L = \\sum w_t (y_t - \\hat{y}_t)^2$, where $w_t = 1 + \\alpha \\cdot (y_t / \\max(y))$.  3.2 Peak Probability Classification (The \"Trigger\")  Instead of just predicting kW, a secondary model should predict the   probability   that the current day will set a monthly peak.  ●   Architecture:   Random Forest   or   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)   classifier. 17  ●   Binary Output:   Is Today A Peak Day? (Yes/No).  ●   Logic:  ○   If $P(Peak) < Threshold$: Enter   Conservation Mode . Maintain high SoC, perform only shallow arbitrage.   Do not shave load.  ○   If $P(Peak) > Threshold$: Enter   Peak Shaving Mode . Pre-charge to 100% before the window.  ●   Correction:   This specific logic gate prevents the \"shave all day\" error by disabling the shaving function entirely on days identified as non-critical. 19  4. Mathematical Formulation: Giving the AI the \"Math\"  The user explicitly asked to \"give it the math.\" Whether implementing a deterministic solver (MILP) or training a stochastic agent (RL), the fundamental mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is identical. The core challenge is linearizing the non-continuous \"Max\" function of the demand charge.\n\n4.1 Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Formulation  This formulation defines the theoretical optimum. It should be used to generate training data for the AI (Imitation Learning) or as the core logic in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) wrapper. 20  Objective Function:  Minimize the total cost $J$ over the horizon $T$:  $$ \\min J = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( C_{energy}(t) \\cdot P_{grid}(t) \\cdot \\Delta t \\right) + C_{demand} \\cdot P_{peak} + \\sum_{t=1}^{T} C_{deg}(P_{batt}(t)) $$  Where:  ●   $P_{grid}(t)$: Power drawn from the grid at time $t$.  ●   $C_{demand}$: Demand charge rate ($\\$/kW$).  ●   $P_{peak}$: A decision variable representing the maximum billing demand for the month.  ●   $C_{deg}$: Battery degradation cost per kWh.  Constraints:  1.   Peak Definition (Linearization):  To minimize $P_{peak}$, we constrain it to be greater than or equal to the grid load at every time step. The solver, seeking to minimize cost, will squeeze $P_{peak}$ down until it rests on the single highest load point.13  $$P_{peak} \\ge P_{grid}(t) \\quad \\forall t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$$  2.   Ratchet / Peak-So-Far Constraint:  This is the mathematical fix for the \"shaving all day\" error. We constrain the solution such that $P_{peak}$ cannot be lower than the peak already observed in the past.  $$P_{peak} \\ge P_{max\\_observed}$$  ○   Effect:   If the facility already hit 500 kW on Day 1, and today is Day 15 with a forecasted max of 450 kW, this constraint makes $P_{peak}$ a fixed constant (500 kW) in the optimization. The marginal value of reducing the 450 kW load to 400 kW becomes  zero   in the demand charge term. The solver will effectively \"turn off\" peak shaving (unless energy arbitrage justifies it), preventing battery waste. 8  3.   Power Balance:  $$P_{grid}(t) = P_{load}(t) - P_{batt\\_dis}(t) + P_{batt\\_ch}(t)$$  4.   Energy Continuity (SoC):  $$E(t+1) = E(t) + P_{batt\\_ch}(t) \\eta_{ch} \\Delta t - \\frac{P_{batt\\_dis}(t) \\Delta t}{\\eta_{dis}}$$  5.   Capacity Limits:\n\n$$E_{min} \\le E(t) \\le E_{max}$$  $$0 \\le P_{batt\\_ch}(t) \\le P_{converter\\_max}$$  $$0 \\le P_{batt\\_dis}(t) \\le P_{converter\\_max}$$  4.2 Terminal Constraints for Rolling Horizon  Since we cannot solve for the whole month at once (forecast accuracy degrades), we solve for a 24-48 hour horizon. However, a short horizon can lead to \"greedy\" depletion.  ●   Terminal Energy Constraint:   $E(T) \\ge E_{reserve}$. Forces the battery to end the day with enough energy to handle tomorrow's predicted volatility.  ●   Terminal Peak Cost:   Add a cost term to the objective function representing the expected future value of the peak.  5. Reinforcement Learning (RL): The Adaptive Controller  While MILP is powerful, it is brittle to forecast errors. Reinforcement Learning (RL) creates a robust policy that maps states to actions, learning to manage risk implicitly.  5.1 The Sparse Reward Problem  The central difficulty in training RL for peak shaving is   Sparse Rewards . The agent only sees the \"Demand Charge\" penalty once a month. For the other 29 days, the feedback loop is broken.  ●   Symptom:   The agent acts randomly or optimizes only for the dense reward (energy arbitrage), leading to \"shaving all day.\"  5.2 Reward Shaping Strategy\n\nTo fix this, we must construct a   Synthetic Reward Function   that provides feedback at every time step $t$. 23  $$R_t = R_{energy} + R_{peak\\_tracking} + R_{degradation}$$  1.   Peak Tracking Reward:  $$R_{peak\\_tracking} = - \\lambda_{penalty} \\cdot \\max(0, P_{grid}(t) - P_{max\\_so\\_far})$$  ○   Mechanism:   This term punishes the agent   immediately   and heavily whenever it allows the grid load to exceed the \"watermark\" set by previous days. This creates a continuous \"electric fence\" around the current peak. 25  2.   Degradation Cost (The Idle Incentive):  $$R_{degradation} = - C_{wear} \\cdot |P_{batt}(t)|$$  ○   Mechanism:   By imposing a small cost on every action, the agent learns that   doing nothing (Idling) is better than doing something low-value.   This is the direct cure for \"shaving all day.\" If the arbitrage spread or peak reduction value doesn't exceed $C_{wear}$, the optimal action is to sit still. 26  5.3 Algorithm Selection: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)  For battery control,   Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)   is the recommended algorithm over DQN or PPO. 27  ●   Continuous Action Space:   SAC outputs a continuous value (e.g., \"Discharge 34.5 kW\") rather than discrete steps (\"Discharge 30kW\" or \"40kW\"). This precision is vital for hitting exact peak targets without under-shaving or over-discharging.  ●   Entropy Regularization:   SAC encourages exploration, preventing the agent from getting stuck in a local optimum (e.g., \"never discharge\") early in training.  6. Coincident Peak (CP) Strategies  In jurisdictions like ERCOT (4CP), PJM (5CP), or IESO (Global Adjustment), the demand charge is based on the   grid's   peak, not the customer's. This requires a fundamentally different logic path.  6.1 Data Requirements for CP\n\nThe customer's internal load data is irrelevant for   predicting   the CP event (though relevant for  managing   it). The AI must ingest:  ●   ISO/RTO Load Forecasts:   API feeds from the grid operator (e.g., PJM Data Miner).  ●   Grid-Scale Weather:   Temperature forecasts for major load centers (e.g., Dallas/Houston for ERCOT 4CP).  6.2 \"All-In\" Dispatch Logic  When a CP event is probable, the objective function shifts from \"Efficiency\" to \"Maximum Impact.\"  ●   Threshold:   If $Forecast_{ISO} > P_{threshold}$ (e.g., top 1% of historical loads), trigger CP Mode.  ●   Action:   Discharge at   maximum rated power   ($P_{max}$) regardless of building load (up to the point of zero net export, unless export is compensated).  ●   Probabilistic Dispatch:   Since CP timing is uncertain, the AI uses a \"Shotgun Approach,\" discharging during the probable 3-4 hour window. The cost of \"wasting\" a cycle on a false alarm is negligible compared to the risk of missing the CP event, which can cost hundreds of dollars per kW. 29  7. Battery Degradation and Life Cycle Management  A BESS is a depreciating asset. Every cycle consumes a portion of its finite life. The \"shaving all day\" behavior is not just operationally inefficient; it is financially destructive.  7.1 Degradation Physics  ●   Cycle Aging:   Caused by the mechanical stress of lithium ions intercalating into the anode/cathode. Proportional to throughput and Depth of Discharge (DoD).  ●   Calendar Aging:   Caused by parasitic chemical reactions, accelerated by high State of Charge (SoC) and temperature.\n\n7.2 Cost Integration  To prevent \"busy work,\" the AI needs a Hurdle Rate.  $$Cost_{throughput} = \\frac{\\text{Battery Replacement Cost}}{\\text{Total Lifetime Energy Throughput}}$$  Example:  ●   Cost: $\\$500/kWh_{cap}$  ●   Life: 4000 cycles  ●   Throughput Cost $\\approx \\$0.06/kWh$.  If the AI attempts to shave a load spike that saves only $\\$0.04/kWh$ in demand charges (because it’s a non-peak day), the equation $Savings - Cost_{throughput}$ becomes negative. The optimizer will correctly choose to   Idle . This mathematical \"friction\" is the mechanism that stops continuous discharging. 30  8. Implementation Guide  To implement this correctly using the Python ecosystem:  1.   Optimization Engine:   Use   Pyomo   or   PuLP   to build the MILP formulation described in Section 4. Connect it to a solver like   CBC   (open source) or   Gurobi   (commercial).  ○   Why?   Symbolic modeling allows you to explicitly write the constraint model.peak >= model.grid_import[t].  2.   Forecasting:   Use   TensorFlow   or   PyTorch   to build the LSTM models.  ○   Why?   Deep learning libraries handle the complex sequence data of load profiles.  3.   Data Pipeline:   Use   Pandas   for resampling interval data (e.g., df.resample('15T').mean()) and   Scikit-Learn   for preprocessing (scaling).  Summary of the Fix  The transition from \"shaving all day\" to \"intelligent peaking\" requires:  1.   Awareness:   Ingesting \"Peak-So-Far\" and \"Billing Cycle Progress\" features.  2.   Valuation:   Implementing a \"Peak Tracking\" reward function that punishes new maximums.\n\n3.   Friction:   Adding degradation costs to penalize low-value discharging.  4.   Math:   Using MILP or Shaped RL to linearize the max-function and optimize for the   billing determinant , not just energy volume.  By feeding the AI these specific mathematical constraints and data features, it will naturally converge on the optimal strategy: periods of dormancy punctuated by decisive, high-power discharges during the critical monthly peak intervals.

    "text": "Technical Reference Architecture: NREL System Advisor Model (SAM) Algorithms for Battery Storage and Energy Efficiency  Executive Summary  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM) stands as the preeminent techno-economic modeling platform for renewable energy systems. For software architects and engineers tasked with developing robust application logic libraries for Energy Management Systems (EMS) or grid-edge controllers, SAM provides a validated, physics-based foundation. This report offers an exhaustive technical analysis of the algorithms, mathematical formulations, and control logic embedded within the SAM Simulation Core (SSC), specifically focusing on the cmod_battery compute module and its supporting libraries.  The analysis is structured to serve as a comprehensive \"blueprint\" for porting SAM's logic into standalone application environments. It dissects the system into three primary architectural domains:   Performance Modeling   (voltage, capacity, and thermal dynamics),   Lifetime and Degradation Analysis   (rainflow cycle counting and electrochemical fade mechanisms), and  Dispatch Control Logic   (automated peak shaving, price signal response, and ramp rate control). By referencing the underlying C++ source code structures and technical reference manuals, this document bridges the gap between theoretical battery physics and executable software logic.  Crucially, this report distinguishes between   Behind-the-Meter (BTM)   applications, where logic prioritizes demand charge reduction and efficiency to minimize customer utility bills, and  Front-of-Meter (FOM)   applications, where optimization targets merchant revenue and grid stability. Furthermore, it details the integration of the BatteryStateful module from the PySAM software development kit (SDK), which enables step-by-step external control—a critical feature for developing custom EMS applications that must react to real-time telemetry.  The findings indicate that accurate battery modeling cannot rely on simple \"bucket\" energy models. Instead, it requires a coupled system of differential equations solving for voltage sag, thermal accumulation, and non-linear degradation. The algorithms detailed herein—specifically the   Modified Shepard-Tremblay Voltage Model , the   3-Point Rainflow Counting Algorithm , and the   Sorted Grid Power Dispatch Heuristic —represent the minimum viable logic required to replicate NREL-validated performance in a proprietary software stack.  1. Architectural Foundation: The SAM Simulation Core (SSC)  The computational engine driving SAM is the SAM Simulation Core (SSC), a high-performance numerical solver written primarily in C++. Understanding the SSC structure is a prerequisite to extracting its logic for external applications. The battery model in SAM is not a standalone entity in the default user interface; rather, it is integrated into broader system models (e.g., PV-Battery, Generic-Battery) to capture the synergistic effects of generation and storage. However, for the purpose of app logic libraries, the Generic Battery configuration effectively isolates the storage\n\nlogic, allowing it to be treated as a standalone system for testing and validation.  1.1 Module Structure and Data Flow  The battery logic is encapsulated primarily within specific C++ library files in the SSC repository, which developers can inspect for ground-truth algorithmic verification. The core logic resides in lib_battery.cpp (physics), lib_battery_dispatch.cpp (control), and lib_battery_lifetime_calendar_cycle.cpp (degradation). The data flow follows a strict sequential execution path for each time step (typically hourly or sub-hourly), ensuring physical consistency.  The execution sequence for a single time step t is as follows:  1.   Input State Assessment:   The model reads the state variables from the previous time step t-1, including Temperature (T_{batt}), State of Charge (SOC), and Voltage (V_{batt}).  2.   Thermal Calculation:   The thermal model solves the heat balance equation to update the battery temperature based on the previous step's heat generation and the current ambient conditions. This must occur   first   because capacity is temperature-dependent.  3.   Capacity Adjustment:   The available capacity (Q_{max}) is modified based on the new temperature T_{batt} and the cumulative degradation state (State of Health, SOH).  4.   Dispatch Decision:   The BatteryDispatch module calculates the target power (P_{target}) based on the selected controller strategy (e.g., peak shaving, price arbitrage) and the specific load forecast.  5.   Operating Constraints:   The ideal target power is clamped by physical limits: maximum C-rate (I_{max}), voltage limits (V_{min}, V_{max}), and power converter ratings.  6.   State Update:   The BatteryStateful logic integrates the current to update the SOC and calculates the cumulative energy throughput.  7.   Degradation Calculation:   The Lifetime module applies rainflow counting (cycle fade) and time-dependent decay (calendar fade) to update the SOH for the next time step.  1.2 PySAM Wrapper and Stateful Execution  For application developers, the PySAM wrapper provides the most accessible interface to the SSC. Specifically, the BatteryStateful module allows for \"step-by-step\" execution, which is distinct from the standard simulation that runs an entire year in a single batch process. BatteryStateful maintains the system state in memory, allowing an external agent (the app logic) to read the state, calculate a control signal, and inject it back into the simulation for the next step.  This stateful architecture mirrors the operation of a real-world hardware controller or a \"Hardware-in-the-Loop\" simulation. It requires the developer to instantiate the model, initialize parameters, and then explicitly call the execute() function within a time-series loop. This approach allows for the injection of dynamic control logic that may depend on external API calls (e.g., real-time weather or pricing) which are not known at the start of the simulation.  1.3 Time Resolution and Simulation Steps  The SSC engine is designed to handle variable time resolutions, ranging from 1-minute to 1-hour steps. However, the logic for certain algorithms—specifically the   Rainflow Counting   and  Thermal Solver —is sensitive to the time step.  ●   Thermal Logic:   Uses an implicit solver to maintain stability at long time steps (1 hour) where explicit solvers might oscillate.  ●   Dispatch Logic:   Algorithms like peak shaving typically operate on a 24-hour look-ahead window, regardless of the sub-hourly resolution of the step simulation.\n\n●   Implication:   When building an app library, the logic must decouple the \"Decision Interval\" (e.g., re-optimizing the schedule every hour) from the \"Physics Interval\" (e.g., calculating voltage sag every minute).  2. Battery Performance Modeling Algorithms  The \"Performance Model\" in SAM refers to the set of equations that describe the instantaneous electrical and thermal behavior of the battery. While the model structure is generic, it relies on specific parameter sets to simulate distinct chemistries such as Lead-acid, Lithium-ion (NMC, LFP), and Flow batteries (Vanadium, Iron).  2.1 Electrochemical Voltage Models  Accurate voltage modeling is critical because it determines the cutoff points for charge and discharge, thereby defining the effective usable capacity and the energy efficiency. SAM employs two primary methods for voltage modeling: the   Shepard/Tremblay Electrochemical Model   and the   Table Lookup Method .  2.1.1 The Modified Shepard-Tremblay Model  For Lithium-ion and Lead-acid batteries, SAM utilizes a modified version of the Shepard model, extended by Tremblay. This phenomenological model describes the battery terminal voltage (V_{batt}) as a function of the open-circuit voltage, internal resistance, and the polarization dynamics caused by the state of charge. The governing equation implemented in the SSC is:  Where:  ●   E_0 (V):   The battery constant voltage (Open Circuit Voltage at full charge).  ●   R (\\Omega):   The internal series resistance. This is the primary contributor to voltage sag under load and heat generation (I^2R).  ●   i (A):   The battery current (positive for discharge, negative for charge).  ●   K (V/Ah or \\Omega):   The polarization constant. This term models the non-linear voltage decay as the battery approaches depletion. The fraction \\frac{Q}{Q - it} creates a hyperbolic drop-off, simulating the rapid voltage collapse at the end of discharge.  ●   Q (Ah):   The maximum battery capacity.  ●   it (Ah):   The actual battery charge extracted.  ●   i^* (A):   The filtered current, often used to dampen the response in dynamic simulations to represent diffusion time constants.  ●   A (V):   The exponential zone amplitude.  ●   B (Ah^{-1}):   The exponential zone time constant inverse.  Context and Implications:   This equation creates the characteristic \"S-curve\" or \"knee\" seen in Li-ion voltage profiles. The exponential term (A \\exp(-B \\cdot it)) dominates the initial voltage drop (the \"exponential zone\") immediately after a full charge. The polarization term (K) dominates the end-of-discharge curve. When implementing this logic, it is vital to include boundary checks for it \\approx Q to prevent division-by-zero errors in the polarization term. SAM handles this by clamping the voltage to the cutoff limit once capacity is exhausted.  2.1.2 Table-Based Voltage Model  Certain battery chemistries, such as Vanadium Redox Flow batteries or specific LFP cells with very flat discharge curves, may not be accurately represented by the Shepard equation. For these cases, SAM provides a table-based input option (voltage_matrix).\n\n●   Structure:   A 2D array mapping Depth of Discharge (DOD) to Voltage.  ●   Algorithm:   The simulation performs linear interpolation between the defined points to determine the voltage at any specific SOC.  ●   Requirement:   The table must be monotonic to ensure a unique mapping between Voltage and SOC.  2.2 Capacity and Efficiency Logic  The \"Tank of Charge\" model serves as the baseline for capacity tracking in Li-ion systems. However, this is modified by the   Peukert Effect   for Lead-acid batteries and by temperature coefficients for all chemistries.  2.2.1 Round-Trip Efficiency (RTE) Calculation  A common misconception is that Round-Trip Efficiency (RTE) is a static input parameter in detailed models. In SAM's physics-based model, RTE is an   output   derived from the integration of losses over time. The algorithm calculates energy flux at every time step:  $$ \\eta_{RTE} = \\frac{\\sum E_{discharged}}{\\sum E_{charged}} = \\frac{\\sum (V_{out} \\cdot I_{out} \\cdot \\Delta t)}{\\sum (V_{in} \\cdot I_{in} \\cdot \\Delta t)} $$  The losses are derived from two main sources:  1.   Ohmic Losses:   Calculated as I^2R using the internal resistance R from the voltage model. This means efficiency is inversely proportional to the C-rate (higher current = lower efficiency).  2.   Conversion Losses:   Power converter efficiencies (\\eta_{inv}) applied to the AC-to-DC and DC-to-AC conversions.  Insight:   This dynamic calculation implies that an app logic library cannot simply assume a \"90% efficient\" battery. It must model the underlying resistance to accurately predict the energy cost of high-power operations like peak shaving.  2.2.2 Thermal Capacity Adjustment  Battery capacity is highly dependent on temperature. SAM models this using a capacity correction factor logic. The nominal capacity (Q_{nom}) is multiplied by a temperature-dependent factor \\eta_{temp}(T):  Typically, capacity decreases at lower temperatures due to reduced ionic mobility in the electrolyte. SAM allows this relationship to be defined via a lookup table or built-in curve fits. This adjustment is applied   before   the dispatch logic determines the available energy for the day, meaning a cold battery will have a reduced ability to shave peaks.  2.3 Thermal Thermodynamics Model  The thermal model in SAM is a \"Lumped Capacitance\" model that tracks the bulk temperature of the battery bank. It accounts for internal heat generation and heat exchange with the environment, solving the energy balance equation:  Where:  ●   m (kg):   The total mass of the battery bank.  ●   C_p (J/kg·K):   The specific heat capacity of the battery material.  ●   Q_{gen} (W):   Internal heat generation, primarily calculated as I^2 R.  ●   h (W/m^2K):   The heat transfer coefficient to the surroundings.  ●   A (m^2):   The surface area available for heat transfer.\n\n●   T_{amb} (K):   The ambient temperature (from weather file or user input).  Numerical Implementation - The Trapezoidal Method:   To solve this differential equation numerically within the simulation, SAM employs a second-order, unconditionally stable   Implicit Trapezoidal Method . This is a critical algorithmic choice. Simple Euler methods (T_{new} = T_{old} + Rate \\times \\Delta t) can become unstable (oscillate wildly) if the time step is large (e.g., 1 hour) relative to the thermal time constant of the battery.  The implicit update equation implemented is:  This logic requires an iterative solution (or algebraic rearrangement) at each time step to solve for T_{t+1}. For app developers, replicating this implicit solver is necessary to prevent \"thermal runaway\" artifacts in simulations where the battery is cycled aggressively.  3. Degradation and Lifetime Analysis Algorithms  One of SAM's most distinguishing features is its robust lifetime modeling, which separates degradation into   Calendar Fade   (aging due to time and conditions) and   Cycle Fade   (aging due to usage). These models are critical for calculating the Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) and determining replacement schedules.  3.1 Cycle Fade: The Rainflow Counting Algorithm  Standard cycle counting is insufficient for real-world battery operations because batteries rarely undergo full 0-100% cycles. Instead, they experience a chaotic series of partial charges and discharges (e.g., 80% \\to 75% \\to 80%). SAM implements the   Rainflow Counting Algorithm , adapted from fatigue analysis in materials science (ASTM E1049-85), to decompose this complex signal into discrete cycles.  3.1.1 Implementation Logic: The 3-Point Method  The algorithm operates on the   Depth of Discharge (DOD)   profile, not the SOC directly. The process steps are:  1.   Extrema Identification:   The system converts the time-series DOD data into a sequence of peaks and valleys (local extrema).  2.   Stack Processing:   These points are pushed onto a processing stack.  3.   3-Point Evaluation:   The algorithm evaluates the three most recent points on the stack, let's call them X, Y, and Z.  ○   Calculate range r_1 = |X - Y| (the most recent half-cycle).  ○   Calculate range r_2 = |Y - Z| (the preceding half-cycle).  4.   Cycle Closure Condition:   The core logic check is:   Is r_1 \\le r_2?  ○   If True:   The cycle defined by range r_1 is considered \"closed\" or complete. It is recorded as a cycle of depth r_1. The points X and Y are removed from the stack, and the algorithm checks the previous points.  ○   If False:   The cycle is not yet closed. The points remain on the stack as \"residue\" waiting for a future reversal large enough to close them.  3.1.2 The \"Steps of 3\" Phenomenon and Residue  Users analyzing SAM outputs may notice that the cycle count sometimes jumps by non-integer values or integer steps greater than one (e.g., +3 cycles in one time step). This is a direct artifact of the   Residue Stack . Small fluctuations (micro-cycles) may accumulate in the stack as unclosed loops. A single large discharge event can satisfy the closure condition for multiple\n\nnested loops simultaneously, causing them all to be processed and counted in a single batch.  Implementation Warning:   App logic developers cannot implement a simple \"zero-crossing\" counter. To replicate SAM's accuracy, the app must maintain a persistent \"Residue Stack\" in its state memory, carrying over unclosed cycles from one simulation step to the next.  3.2 Calendar Fade: The Smith (2017) Model  For Lithium-ion chemistries, particularly NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) and LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate), SAM utilizes semi-empirical models developed by NREL (Smith et al., 2017). This model predicts capacity fade (Q_{loss}) and resistance growth (R_{growth}) as functions of temperature (T), SOC, and time (t).  3.2.1 Arrhenius Kinetics and Time Dependence  The degradation rate follows Arrhenius kinetics, implying an exponential sensitivity to temperature. The general form of the equation implemented is:  Where:  ●   T_{kelvin}:   The battery temperature. This underscores the importance of the thermal model; a 10^\\circ C error in temperature can double the predicted degradation rate.  ●   t^{z}:   Represents the time dependence. Typically, z=0.5 (square root of time), reflecting the diffusion-limited growth of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. Degradation is rapid initially and slows as the SEI layer thickens.  ●   SOC Factor:   SAM models include an SOC stress factor. High SOC (e.g., >90%) increases the electrochemical potential at the anode, accelerating side reactions. This is often modeled as a linear or exponential multiplier on the base Arrhenius rate.  3.2.2 Chemistry-Specific Logic (LFP vs. NMC)  ●   NMC/Graphite:   The logic typically combines calendar and cycle fade into a unified semi-empirical model.  ●   LFP:   Due to the stability of LFP, SAM often defaults to a simpler table-based calendar fade if the algebraic parameters are not explicitly provided. This utilizes bilinear interpolation of input matrices for Time and Temperature.  3.3 State of Health (SOH) Aggregation  The total SOH is the effective remaining capacity relative to the nameplate capacity. SAM applies the   Maximum Loss   logic (or sometimes summation, depending on configuration) to determine the effective life:  This logic assumes that the dominant degradation mechanism (e.g., calendar aging during idle periods vs. mechanical fracture during heavy cycling) dictates the battery's health. The end-of-life (EOL) is typically defined as the point where Q_{actual} drops below 80% of Q_{nom}, though this threshold is user-configurable.  4. Behind-the-Meter (BTM) Dispatch Algorithms  Dispatch logic determines   when   to charge or discharge the battery. For BTM systems, the primary objective is minimizing the customer's utility bill, which consists of energy charges (/kWh) and demand charges (/kW).\n\n4.1 Automated Peak Shaving Algorithm  The Peak Shaving controller is the most sophisticated BTM algorithm in SAM. It is designed to reduce demand charges by flattening the load curve. It typically operates on a 24-hour look-ahead window.  4.1.1 Algorithm Step 1: Grid Power Sorting  The logic begins by analyzing the load forecast for the next 24 hours.  ●   Input:   Net Load = Building Load - PV Generation.  ●   Process:   The algorithm creates a list of the grid power required at every time step of the look-ahead window.  ●   Action:   It   sorts   these power values from highest to lowest.  ●   Reasoning:   The highest values represent the \"peaks\" that determine the demand charge. By attacking the sorted list from the top down, the algorithm prioritizes the most expensive intervals.  4.1.2 Algorithm Step 2: Target Power Determination  The controller seeks a \"Target Power\" (P_{target})—a threshold above which the battery will discharge to \"shave\" the load.  ●   Iterative Search:   The algorithm iterates through the sorted grid power list. For a candidate target P_{i}, it calculates the total energy (kWh) required to shave all peaks exceeding P_{i} down to P_{i}.  ●   Energy Constraint:   This required energy is compared to the available battery energy (E_{batt}).  ○   If Energy_{required} > E_{batt}, the target is too aggressive (too low). The algorithm moves to the next higher power level in the sorted list.  ○   If Energy_{required} \\le E_{batt}, this is a feasible target.  4.1.3 Algorithm Step 3: The Monthly Peak Latch  A critical, often overlooked logic gate in SAM is the   Monthly Peak Tracker .  ●   Context:   Demand charges are typically based on the single highest peak of the billing cycle (month).  ●   Logic:   The algorithm tracks the maximum demand recorded   so far   in the current month (P_{max\\_month}).  ●   Constraint:   The calculated P_{target} is compared to P_{max\\_month}.  ○   If P_{target} < P_{max\\_month}, the algorithm forces P_{target} = P_{max\\_month}.  ●   Implication:   There is no financial benefit to shaving the daily peak below a peak that has already occurred earlier in the month. This logic preserves battery energy for future, higher peaks.  4.2 Price Signal and Arbitrage Dispatch  This controller optimizes for Time-of-Use (TOU) rates or real-time pricing.  ●   Objective:   Maximize the value of energy arbitrage (Buy low, Sell high).  ●   Logic Heuristic:   Unlike a full linear optimization (which is computationally expensive), SAM often uses a heuristic approach:  1.   Rank Prices:   Sort the look-ahead window by electricity price.\n\n2.   Discharge Priority:   Allocate available discharge capacity to the highest price tiers.  3.   Charge Priority:   Allocate charging to the lowest price tiers.  4.   Cycle Cost Gate:   A crucial check is the cycle cost comparison. The algorithm will only schedule a dispatch if the spread between the high and low price exceeds the \"Cost of Cycling\" (an input parameter or calculated from battery replacement cost).  ○   Condition: (Price_{high} - Price_{low}) \\cdot \\eta_{RTE} > Cost_{cycle}.  4.3 Manual Dispatch and Constraints  For users requiring exact control, SAM accepts a manual dispatch schedule.  ●   Inputs:   dispatch_manual_charge (kW), dispatch_manual_discharge (kW), or dispatch_manual_percent arrays.  ●   Constraint Hierarchy:   Even in manual mode, the physical constraints (SOC limits, Voltage limits, C-rate limits)   always override   the manual instructions. This \"physics-first\" hierarchy is essential for app logic safety—it ensures that a user command cannot violate the safe operating area of the battery.  5. Front-of-Meter (FOM) Dispatch Algorithms  FOM logic focuses on revenue generation through energy sales, requiring different optimization objectives compared to BTM peak shaving.  5.1 Economic Dispatch (Merchant Plant)  This algorithm uses linear programming or heuristic optimization to maximize revenue based on Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) or PPA rates.  ●   Logic:  ○   Charge when LMP < Threshold_{charge}.  ○   Discharge when LMP > Threshold_{discharge}.  ●   Threshold Calculation:   The thresholds are often dynamic, calculated based on the round-trip efficiency (\\eta_{RTE}) to ensure marginal profitability: Price_{sell} > Price_{buy} / \\eta_{RTE}.  5.2 PV Smoothing / Ramp Rate Control  This algorithm is designed to mitigate rapid fluctuations in PV output, which can cause grid instability. It is an efficiency algorithm for grid integration.  ●   Objective:   Limit the rate of change of power injection into the grid (e.g., < 10\\%/minute).  ●   Mathematical Logic:  ●   Action:  ○   If Ramp(t) > Limit (Rising too fast): Charge the battery to absorb the excess.  ○   If Ramp(t) < -Limit (Falling too fast): Discharge the battery to buffer the drop.  ●   Look-Ahead:   Advanced versions use a \"look-ahead\" forecast to pre-position the SOC (e.g., to 50%) if a massive ramp event is predicted, ensuring there is headroom to charge or energy to discharge.  5.3 Forecasting Horizons: Perfect vs. Day-Ahead  SAM research highlights the critical impact of forecasting accuracy on dispatch efficiency.  ●   Perfect Look-Ahead:   The controller \"sees\" the exact weather and load file data for the\n\nnext 24 hours. This establishes the theoretical maximum performance.  ●   Day-Ahead Forecast:   Uses a separate weather/load file (or a perturbed version of the actuals) to simulate forecast error.  ●   Quantitative Insight:   Research indicates that using perfect forecasts overestimates the value of storage by   1-8%   compared to realistic day-ahead forecasts.  ●   App Logic Implication:   To accurately simulate real-world performance, an app library should implement a \"Rolling Horizon\" update, where the forecast is updated every hour to reduce error, mimicking Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies.  6. Implementation Architecture: Porting to Code  To implement these algorithms in a custom library, developers must map the conceptual logic to specific variable structures found in the PySAM SDK.  6.1 The BatteryStateful Module Logic  The BatteryStateful class is the designated tool for custom logic implementation. It allows the simulation to be paused and resumed, enabling \"Step-by-Step\" control loops.  Theoretical Implementation Loop:  1.   Initialization:   Instantiate BatteryStateful.new() and load default parameters.  2.   Time Step Loop (t=0 to T):  ○   Step A (Read State):   Access batt.StatePack to get current SOC, Temperature, and Voltage.  ○   Step B (External Logic):   The app executes its custom dispatch logic (e.g., a proprietary peak shaving heuristic or an API call to a cloud optimizer) to determine the desired power P_{cmd}.  ○   Step C (Inject Command):   Set batt.StatePack.P_dispatch = P_cmd.  ○   Step D (Execute Physics):   Call batt.execute(1). This triggers the SSC to solve the Shepard voltage equation, the implicit thermal equation, and the rainflow degradation logic for one time step.  ○   Step E (Record):   Store the results and repeat.  6.2 Key Variable Mapping Table  The following table maps the conceptual parameters to specific PySAM variable names required for implementation.  Concept   PySAM Variable   Description  Dispatch Mode   batt_disp[span_35](start_span)[  span_35](end_span)atch_choic  e  0=Manual, 1=Peak Shaving,  2=Input Target, 3=Price Signal  Battery Capacity   batt_computed_bank_capacity   Total kWh capacity of the bank  (calculated from cells)  Chemistry Type   batt_chem   0=Lead Acid, 1=Li-ion,  2=Vanadium Flow, 3=Iron Flow  Min SOC Limit   batt_minimum_SOC   Hard constraint for lower limit  (%)  Rainflow Counts   cycle_counts   Input for custom rainflow  counting in Stateful mode  Manual Target   dispatch_manual_power   Target kW (positive=charge,\n\nConcept   PySAM Variable   Description  negative=discharge)  Cycle Cost   batt_cycle_cost   Cost threshold ($/cycle-kWh)  for arbitrage logic  6.3 Common Logic Pitfalls  ●   Interdependency Order:   A common error is calculating capacity before temperature. Since Q_{avail} = f(T), the thermal solver must strictly run   before   the capacity logic in each step.  ●   Metering Mode:   In BTM applications, the batt_meter_position variable is critical. If set to \"Buy All / Sell All,\" the battery is effectively behind a separate meter, and self-consumption logic will fail. It must be set to \"Net Metering\" for standard BTM peak shaving behavior.  7. Energy Efficiency and Load Management Logic  While SAM is primarily a generation/storage tool, its capabilities extend to   Demand Side Management (DSM) , utilizing logic derived from NREL's   dsgrid   toolkit.  7.1 Load Forecasting Algorithms  For dispatch algorithms like Peak Shaving to function, the system must predict the load. When \"Perfect Look-Ahead\" is disabled, SAM employs internal forecasting logic.  ●   Simple Moving Average:   The default internal forecaster uses the load from the previous N days to predict the next 24 hours.  ●   Application:   This logic is critical for \"learning\" controllers in EMS apps. It allows the controller to adapt to changing building usage patterns (e.g., seasonal shifts) without needing complex external weather data integrations.  7.2 Efficiency via Peak Reduction  SAM models energy efficiency not just as \"using less energy\" (kWh), but as \"using energy better\" (lower kW peaks). The efficiency logic is intrinsic to the   Grid Power Sorting   algorithm described in Section 4.1. By flattening the load curve, the   effective   efficiency of the grid connection improves (higher load factor). The model allows users to quantify this efficiency gain in financial terms ($ saved / kWh throughput).  Conclusion  The NREL System Advisor Model's battery module represents a convergence of electrochemical physics, thermal thermodynamics, and economic optimization. It distinguishes itself from simple spreadsheet models through its coupled physics engine: efficiency is a function of current (I^2R), capacity is a function of temperature (f(T)), and lifetime is a function of usage complexity (Rainflow).  For application logic libraries, the critical takeaways for replication are:  1.   Adopt Rainflow Counting:   Simple cycle counting is mathematically insufficient for real-world battery usage prediction.  2.   Implement Implicit Thermal Solvers:   Thermal feedback loops are essential for safety and accuracy; explicit solvers risk instability.\n\n3.   Utilize Sorted Grid Power Logic:   The 24-hour look-ahead sorted list is the most effective heuristic for robust demand charge reduction.  4.   Differentiate Constraints:   Logic must rigorously enforce the hierarchy where physical constraints (Voltage/Thermal) always override economic dispatch targets.  By adhering to these algorithmic structures, developers can ensure their applications deliver results consistent with DOE-validated standards and robust enough for commercial deployment.

    "text": "------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 1 — PURPOSE OF THE FINANCIAL MODEL  1.1 Purpose  This manual defines the financial equations, lifecycle cost models, incentive logic, rate-structure modeling, degradation-adjusted economics, loan structures, and AI behavioral rules required to evaluate the economic performance of a commercial battery energy storage system (BESS).  The purpose is to give AI a deterministic, engineering-accurate financial framework that:  Calculates savings correctly  Determines cashflow impacts  Evaluates incentives  Runs NPV, IRR, and payback properly  Prevents inflated or impossible financial outcomes  Explains results clearly  1.2 Audience  This manual is designed for use inside an AI-enabled energy modeling tool supporting:  Sales teams  Engineers  DR aggregators  ESCO modelers  Finance partners  1.3 Modeling Requirements  The financial engine must:  Use deterministic formulas  Respect technical limits from PDF #1 and #2  Enforce tariff rules  Enforce incentive rules  Avoid double-counting  Adjust cashflows for degradation  Handle loan structures correctly  Apply discount rates consistently  Report uncertainty transparently  SECTION 2 — COMPONENTS OF ANNUAL SAVINGS  2.1 Annual Savings  Annual savings come from five major categories:\n\nDemand charge savings  Arbitrage savings  Demand response revenue  Tariff migration value  Operational improvements (HVAC interactions optional)  Annual savings must be reduced by:  Degradation losses  O&M expenses  Cycle penalties (if used)  Loan repayment (in financed scenarios)  2.2 Demand Charge Savings  Demand charges are based on the   highest peak demand   in the billing cycle, not multiple periods.  DemandSavings =  PeakReduction × DemandCharge × 12  Where PeakReduction is determined from the peak-shaving model.  AI must never allow demand savings from multiple TOU categories.  2.3 Arbitrage Savings  Arbitrage revenue:  ArbitrageSavings =  Delivered_kWh_per_day × 365 × (PeakRate − OffPeakRate)  Constraints:  Spread must be positive  Battery must recharge  Cycles per day must be below warranty limits  AI must not assume arbitrage in multiple periods.  2.4 Demand Response Revenue  DRRevenue =  CommittedKW × EventHours × NumEvents × ProgramRate  If DR includes capacity payments:  CapacityPayment =  CommittedKW × MonthlyRate × 12  AI must model DR conflicts with arbitrage and shaving.\n\n2.5 Tariff Migration Savings  Tariff migration occurs when battery enables a more favorable tariff.  MigrationSavings =  AnnualBill_Base − AnnualBill_WithBattery  AI must recompute both full bills.  SECTION 3 — COST STRUCTURE: CAPEX, OPEX, FINANCING  3.1 Total CAPEX Components  AI must sum:  Battery modules  Inverter / PCS hardware  Switchgear  Electrical infrastructure  Controls  Software  Construction labor  Permitting  Engineering  Commissioning  Sales tax  CAPEX must never include incentives.  3.2 Operating Expenses  Annual operating costs include:  EMS software license  Ongoing monitoring  Preventative maintenance  Insurance  Lifecycle replacement accrual  Performance testing  Battery augmentation (if needed)  Typical O&M: 1–3% of CAPEX annually.  3.3 Cycle Degradation Cost  Batteries lose capacity through cycling.  A cycle cost can be included:\n\nCycleCost =  ReplacementCost / (ExpectedCycleLife)  AnnualCycleCost =  CycleCost × CyclesPerYear  AI must include cycle penalties if cycles > 365/year.  3.4 Replacement Cost  If analysis horizon exceeds battery life (e.g., 10-year analysis, 7-year life), AI must apply replacement cost:  ReplacementCost occurs in Year_LifeEnd  DiscountedReplacement =  ReplacementCost / (1 + r)^(LifeEnd)  Replacement cost must appear as a negative cashflow.  3.5 Salvage Value  If battery retains value at the end of analysis:  SalvageValue =  RemainingCapacityValue / (1 + r)^N  AI must not inflate salvage value.  SECTION 4 — PAYBACK METRICS  4.1 Simple Payback  simple_payback =  NetCAPEX / NetAnnualSavings  Where NetCAPEX = CAPEX − incentives.  AI must:  Reject payback if NetAnnualSavings ≤ 0  Warn if payback > analysis horizon  Reject payback if NetCAPEX ≤ 0 without modeling incentives properly  4.2 Discounted Payback  discounted_payback = smallest t where  Σ(NetAnnualSavings / (1+r)^t) ≥ NetCAPEX  4.3 Loan-Adjusted Payback  When financed:\n\nLoanPayback =  TotalLoanPayments / NetAnnualSavings  Loan payments must replace CAPEX in numerator.  AI must not combine both methods.  SECTION 5 — NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV)  5.1 NPV Definition  NPV =  −NetCAPEX + Σ(NetAnnualSavings_t / (1 + r)^t)  Where:  t = year  r = discount rate //must never be negative  5.2 Discount Rate Selection  Typical values:  Commercial: 6–10%  Industrial: 8–15%  Risk-heavy DR: 12–20%  If discount rate missing: AI must request clarification.  5.3 Degradation-Adjusted Savings  NetAnnualSavings must decline as battery degrades:  NetAnnualSavings_t =  DemandSavings_t + ArbitrageSavings_t + DRRevenue_t − OandM_t − DegradationCost_t  Degradation impacts:  usable_kWh  usable_kW  efficiency  cycle performance  5.4 NPV Red Flags AI Must Catch  NPV > 3 × CAPEX → suspected modeling error  NPV negative but IRR high → error  NPV positive but payback > analysis horizon → mismatched assumptions  SECTION 6 — INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)\n\n6.1 IRR Formula  Solve r such that:  0 = −NetCAPEX + Σ(NetAnnualSavings_t / (1+r)^t)  AI must solve with numerical iteration.  6.2 IRR Validity  IRR must lie between −100% and +100%.  If outside → invalid.  6.3 Cases IRR Fails  Negative savings first years  Multiple sign changes  Non-monotonic cashflows  AI must respond:  “IRR undefined due to cashflow characteristics.”  SECTION 7 — FINANCING STRUCTURES: CEFO, OBF, LOANS  7.1 CEFO Logic  CEFO mirrors OBF:  No upfront cost  Payments through utility bill  Term cannot exceed bill savings window  Must be cashflow positive  Savings must exceed loan payments  7.2 CEFO Eligibility  AI must check:  SimplePayback <= program limit  LoanTerm <= max term  Customer type qualifies  Technology qualifies  Project under max cost cap  7.3 OBF Logic  OBF uses similar logic but is more rigid.  AI must check payback-based loan term.  7.4 Loan Payment Calculation  Payment =  LoanAmount × (r_month / (1 − (1 + r_month)^(-TermMonths)))\n\nMonthly interest = annual interest ÷ 12.  7.5 Loan Cashflow Analysis  Loan reduces upfront CAPEX but adds annual payment.  LoanCashflow_t =  NetAnnualSavings_t − LoanPayment  SECTION 8 — SGIP INCENTIVE MODELING (EXTENSIVE)  8.1 SGIP Incentive Types  Base incentive  Equity incentive  Equity resiliency incentive  Step-down blocks  Performance-based coupons (cycling)  8.2 SGIP Base Formula  SGIP =  battery_kWh × incentive_rate  Where incentive_rate changes by step.  Typical General Market Step 1 example:  0.50 $/Wh  Step 2: 0.45  Step 3: 0.40  … etc.  8.3 SGIP Equity and Resiliency  Equity incentives may be:  0.85 $/Wh  Resiliency incentives may be:  1.00 $/Wh+  AI must ensure correct categorization.  8.4 SGIP Performance-Based Incentives  Performance factor PF:  PF = measured discharge energy / expected discharge energy  AnnualPerformancePayment =  PF × cycle_energy × performance_rate\n\nAI must model cycle-based performance payments.  8.5 SGIP vs ITC Basis Interaction  SGIP may reduce basis for federal ITC if treated as cost-sharing grant.  If applicable:  ITC_basis = CAPEX − SGIP  ITC = ITC_basis × ITC_rate  AI must evaluate eligibility.  ------------------------------------------------------------  BATTERY FINANCIAL MODELING MANUAL  PART 2 — ITC, BILL RECONSTRUCTION, REPLACEMENT, RISK MODELING  RAW STRUCTURED ENGINEERING TEXT  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 9 — FEDERAL INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (ITC) MODELING  9.1 Purpose of ITC Modeling  The Investment Tax Credit is one of the most influential financial incentives for battery storage. ITC eligibility rules are strict and depend heavily on charging-source requirements. AI must enforce all IRS rules and avoid any incorrect tax assumptions.  9.2 ITC Eligibility  AI must check the following conditions:  If battery charges more than 75 percent from renewable generation (typically solar) → ITC eligible\n\nIf battery is grid-charged more than 25 percent → ITC reduced or disallowed  If battery is standalone without renewable pairing → not ITC eligible under standard rules (unless falling under new IRA provisions)  If battery participates in arbitrage using grid power → ITC may be impacted  AI must never assume ITC eligibility based solely on presence of battery.  9.3 ITC Basis  ITC_basis =  TotalCAPEX − disallowed_incentives − grants − rebates  SGIP may reduce basis depending on classification.  Utility incentives sometimes reduce basis.  AI must:  Remove any grant-type incentive from basis  Keep performance-based incentives untouched (they do not affect basis)  9.4 ITC Calculation  ITC_amount =  ITC_basis × ITC_rate  Where ITC_rate may be:  30 percent (base)  +10 percent (domestic content)  +10 percent (energy community)  Up to 50 percent with stackable adders  9.5 Depreciation Interaction  ITC reduces MACRS depreciation by half the ITC rate.  DepreciableBasis =  ITC_basis × (1 − ITC_rate/2)  AI must enforce depreciation rules if modeling tax effects.  9.6 ITC Clawback Risk  If battery charging % violates rules after commissioning, ITC may be clawed back.  AI must warn in scenarios where arbitrage lowers renewable charging fraction below thresholds.  ------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — UTILITY BILL RECONSTRUCTION AND TARIFF MIGRATION  ------------------------------------------------------------  10.1 Why Full Bill Reconstruction Is Required  Battery modeling fundamentally changes:  Peak demand  Energy usage distribution  TOU timing  Rate eligibility  Minimum charges  Thus AI must reconstruct the baseline and post-battery bills for accurate savings.  10.2 Baseline Bill Reconstruction  BaselineBill =  Σ(EnergyCharges)  ●   Σ(DemandCharges)  ●   FixedCharges  ●   Riders  ●   Taxes  AI must compute:  BaselineEnergyCharges =  Σ(kWh(t) × Rate(t))  BaselineDemandCharges =  PeakDemand × DemandCharge  Where PeakDemand = max interval load in the month.  10.3 Post-Battery Bill Reconstruction  PostBatteryEnergyCharges =  Σ(kWh_after_battery(t) × Rate(t))  PostBatteryDemandCharges =  (NewPeakDemand × DemandCharge)\n\nMigrationBenefit =  BaselineAnnualBill − PostBatteryAnnualBill  10.4 TOU Changes  Some tariffs allow battery customers to switch to a more favorable TOU schedule.  AI must evaluate eligibility by analyzing:  Load factor  Demand thresholds  Renewable pairing  Battery size  Customer class  10.5 Rate Switching Guardrails  AI must never:  Assume incorrect rates  Switch tariffs without eligibility  Ignore seasonal differences  Mix rates from different tariffs  Assume fixed charges identical across tariffs  10.6 Minimum Charges  Many tariffs include minimum charges per month (e.g., $/kW peak load shape or fixed $/month). AI must include these.  10.7 Energy vs Demand Structures  AI must differentiate:  Energy-only tariffs  Demand-only tariffs  Blended tariffs  Tiered tariffs  Critical peak pricing (CPP)  Ratchet tariffs  10.8 CPP Considerations  If tariff includes CPP surcharges:  Battery may reduce CPP impacts by shaving critical peaks.  AI must model CPP savings separately.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 11 — BATTERY REPLACEMENT AND AUGMENTATION MODELING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  11.1 Replacement vs Augmentation  Replacement: exchange full battery system at end of life  Augmentation: add modules to restore capacity  AI must know difference.  11.2 Replacement Trigger  Replacement required when usable capacity < threshold (typically 70–80 percent).  AI must predict replacement year:  ReplacementYear =  year t where Capacity(t) <= EOL_threshold  11.3 Replacement Cost Modeling  ReplacementCost may equal:  Full CAPEX × replacement_fraction  Where replacement_fraction often 0.4–0.7 of CAPEX due to reuse of PCS, switchgear, and installation infrastructure.  Discounted replacement cost:  ReplacementCost / (1+r)^(ReplacementYear)  11.4 Augmentation Modeling  Augmentation adds capacity over time to maintain SOC margin for DR or shaving.  AI must compute augmentation scenario when:  Degradation makes duration insufficient  DR commitment cannot be met  Peak shaving reduction becomes insufficient  11.5 Augmentation Costs  AugmentationCost_kWh typically lower than initial CAPEX due to reuse of PCS.  AI must express augmentation as mid-horizon capital cost.  11.6 Replacement and Augmentation Interactions  AI must not mix replacement and augmentation incorrectly.  If both required, augmentation occurs first, replacement later.  11.7 End-of-Life Salvage Value  If analysis horizon ends before EOL, salvage value applies.\n\nSalvageValue =  RemainingCapacity × per_kWh_residual_value  Discount to present:  SalvageValue / (1+r)^N  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 12 — DEGRADATION-ADJUSTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  ------------------------------------------------------------  12.1 Why Degradation Matters  Degradation reduces:  Power capability  Energy capability  Efficiency  Cycle life  Dispatch flexibility  DR eligibility  Annual savings must be adjusted downward.  12.2 Adjusted Demand Savings  Shave_t =  min(battery_kW_t, peak_excess)  battery_kW_t decreases over time due to:  Inverter aging  Thermal constraints  Voltage sag  Manufacturer limits on aged systems  DemandSavings_t =  Shave_t × DemandCharge × 12  12.3 Adjusted Arbitrage Savings  ArbitrageSavings_t =  DeliveredDaily_kWh_t × 365 × Spread\n\nWhere DeliveredDaily_kWh_t decreases over time.  12.4 Adjusted DR Revenue  If battery capacity decreases:  CommittedKW may be reduced  DR eligibility may be lost  Event durations may exceed battery capability  AI must lower DR revenue in later years.  12.5 Adjusted O&M  O&M may increase with age due to:  Cooling load increase  Maintenance  Balancing issues  Component replacements  12.6 Complete Degradation Model  AnnualSavings_t =  DemandSavings_t  ●   ArbitrageSavings_t  ●   DRRevenue_t  − OandM_t  − DegradationPenalty_t  AI must apply this series annually into NPV calculation.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 13 — SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MODELING  ------------------------------------------------------------  13.1 Purpose  Battery economics are sensitive to multiple variables. AI must run sensitivity checks to determine project robustness.\n\n13.2 Sensitivity Variables  Demand charge  Spread  Cycle life  Ambient temperature  Tariff changes  Load shape variation  Degradation rate  Incentive availability  Financing rates  13.3 Sensitivity Methods  One-at-a-time (OAT) method: vary one input ±10–20 percent.  Monte Carlo (conceptual only for AI guidance):  vary multiple parameters across ranges.  AI must at least implement OAT.  13.4 Risk Indicators  RiskScore increases if:  NPV extremely sensitive to spread  DR revenue volatile  Degradation rapid  Replacement cost soon  Tariff likely to change  Payback near program limits  AI must warn user if project economically fragile.  13.5 Confidence Rating  AI may assign confidence boundaries to savings based on:  Data quality  Load shape consistency  Battery sizing match  Multiple conflicting incentives  Assumptions required  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 14 — EXTENDED AI GUARDRAILS FOR FINANCIAL MODELING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  14.1 No Inflation of Benefits  AI must never:  Double-count demand savings  Double-count arbitrage  Count arbitrage in part-peak and off-peak  Add DR on top of arbitrage for same interval  Ignore SOC reserves  14.2 No Invalid Incentive Modeling  AI must not:  Apply SGIP to ineligible systems  Apply ITC to grid-charging batteries  Stack incentives incorrectly  Claim rebates not real  14.3 No Invalid Loan Modeling  AI must not:  Use loan term longer than program allows  Ignore CEFO cashflow positivity rules  Mix simple payback with loan payback  Confuse CAPEX and financed costs  14.4 No Incorrect Discounting  AI must:  Apply discount rate uniformly  Discount replacement costs  Discount performance incentives  Apply correct annual periods  14.5 No Violation of Degradation Effects  AI must not:  Use year-1 savings for all years  Ignore end-of-life  Ignore mid-life replacement  14.6 Transparency Requirements  AI must output:  All assumptions  All formulas  All constraints  All reductions applied  Any warnings\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 15 — FULL FINANCIAL EXAMPLES  ------------------------------------------------------------  15.1 Example 1 — Battery with Shaving + Arbitrage  Peak = 400 kW  Demand charge = 25  Spread = 0.15  Battery = 100 kW / 400 kWh  Efficiency = 90 percent  DemandSavings = 30,000  ArbitrageSavings = 19,710  NPV, IRR, payback follow formulas defined.  15.2 Example 2 — DR-Heavy Site  Battery = 200 kW / 600 kWh  DR event = 4 hours  DR payment = 10 dollars per kW-hour  DRRevenue = 200 × 4 × 10 × events  Eligibility must be checked against duration.  15.3 Example 3 — Tariff Migration Only  Battery changes from E-19 to B-10.  AI must rebuild entire bill.  15.4 Example 4 — Replacement Year  Battery degrades to 70 percent at year 7.  Replacement cost applied in year 7.  ------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 16 — IMPLEMENTATION RULES FOR AI\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  16.1 Required Inputs  AI must require:  Tariff  Demand charge  TOU structure  Battery library  Building load  Analysis horizon  Discount rate  Financing method  Incentive applicability  16.2 Calculation Sequence  1 Build load model  2 Determine shaving  3 Determine arbitrage  4 Determine DR  5 Apply constraints  6 Compute annual savings  7 Apply degradation  8 Apply incentives  9 Apply replacement  10 Compute financials  11 Run sensitivities  12 Output results  16.3 Output Requirements  AI must output:  Demand savings  Arbitrage savings  DR revenue  O&M  Replacement cost schedule  NPV  IRR  Simple payback  Polarity of assumptions  Warnings  Confidence level  16.4 Human-Readable Explanations  AI must explain:\n\nHow savings calculated  Which constraints applied  Why battery sized this way  Why incentives apply  What uncertainty exists  ------------------------------------------------------------  END OF PDF #3 — BATTERY FINANCIAL MODELING MANUAL  ------------------------------------------------------------  You now have   3 full technical manuals , ready for export into PDF and ingestion into your AI app library.",
