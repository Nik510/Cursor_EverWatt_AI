    "content": "STARTING THE FULL EXPANDED MANUAL\n\nPDF #1 — Battery Modeling & Sizing Manual\n\nPart 1 (Expanded)\n\n\n\nBATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL\n\nAI ENERGY MODELING PLATFORM\n\nRAW TEXT, HIGH DETAIL, STRUCTURED FORMAT\n\nVERSION 2.0 (EXPANDED)\n\nSECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Purpose of This Manual This manual defines the complete set of engineering principles, mathematical models, calculation rules, AI prompting logic, safety constraints, dispatch strategies, and evaluation procedures required to model and size commercial and industrial battery storage systems. It is designed to be ingested by AI systems and used to support calculations for peak demand reduction, energy arbitrage, demand response participation, backup power analysis, incentive qualification, and integrated multi-measure optimization. All content in this document is deterministic, non-hallucinatory, and based on real-world engineering principles, utility program rules, and industry-standard best practices.\n\n1.2 Background and Intent Battery modeling is traditionally performed by specialized engineers using a wide range of tools including load modeling platforms, financial spreadsheets, utility-specific tariff engines, or simulation tools like NREL SAM. This document translates these engineering requirements into a fully text-based form so that AI tools can replicate this reasoning without ambiguity, inconsistency, or hallucination. The intent is to give an AI system the capability to: Perform engineering-grade modeling from minimal inputs. Suggest optimal battery sizes based on user goals such as ROI, DR eligibility, payback, or bill reduction. Identify utility program incentives automatically. Calculate savings using deterministic formulas, not estimates or guesses. Prevent incorrect or physically impossible modeling results. Explain results to non-engineers in plain language. Adapt to varying data quality and automatically fill missing details using established inference logic.\n\n1.3 Types of Battery Systems Addressed This manual applies to: Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) BESS systems Nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) systems AC-coupled BESS DC-coupled BESS Modular containerized battery systems Behind-the-meter commercial batteries Front-of-the-meter DR-only batteries (with proper modifications)\n\nNot all logic applies to all chemistries, but the overall modeling approach is valid for most commercial systems installed today.\n\n1.4 Inputs Required by the Battery Model The model can operate with high-quality or low-quality inputs. Ideal inputs include: Interval data (kW every 15 minutes or 5 minutes) Monthly billing data (kWh, kW, $) Utility tariff structure including: Peak, part-peak, and off-peak energy rates Non-coincident demand charges On-peak demand charges Seasonal variations Battery specification data from a library including: Nominal power (kW) Nominal energy (kWh) Usable energy fraction Round-trip efficiency Allowed C-rates (charge and discharge) Allowed depth of discharge Cycle life and warranty constraints Inverter rating Site metadata including: Address Climate zone Building type Square footage Operating schedule User-driven goals such as: Maximize ROI Minimize payback Maximize peak shaving Qualify for a specific DR program Qualify for SGIP, CEFO, OBF Find the smallest battery that meets a target demand reduction\n\n1.5 Modeling Assumptions When inputs are missing, the model will rely on inference rules defined in this document. The model must explicitly state which assumptions were applied. The model must never fabricate data that violates physical laws. The model must always disclose uncertainty when assumptions are used.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2 — BATTERY FUNDAMENTALS (EXPANDED)\n\n2.1 Power (kW) Battery power defines the maximum instantaneous rate at which the battery can deliver or absorb energy. It is primarily limited by the inverter but may also be restricted by internal battery chemistry, thermal constraints, and manufacturer-defined discharge limits. Peak shaving depends directly on power rating because demand charges are based on instantaneous or interval demand.\n\nThe model must always compare the following: Battery nominal power Battery continuous discharge rating Inverter continuous AC rating Inverter short-term power rating Warranty discharge limit\n\nPeak shaving uses the lowest of these values.\n\n2.2 Energy (kWh) Energy defines how much total energy a battery can store. It determines how long the battery can maintain a specific discharge rate. For example, a 100 kW / 100 kWh battery at 100 kW can discharge for 1 hour. Batteries with high energy relative to power perform better in long-duration events such as extended demand charge windows or DR events requiring more than one hour.\n\nThe model must never assume energy equal to nominal energy; it must account for usable capacity and degradation.\n\n2.3 Usable Energy and Depth of Discharge Actual usable energy depends on: Depth of discharge limit (e.g., 80–90 percent) Battery temperature Age of the battery Inverter conversion losses Cell balancing overhead\n\nUsable energy equals: Nominal energy multiplied by usable fraction.\n\nDifferent manufacturers define usable fraction differently, such as: Total battery capacity minus reserved buffer Full usable window defined in warranty Charge windows for solar clipping\n\nThe model must always track usable energy separately from nominal energy.\n\n2.4 Round Trip Efficiency Round-trip efficiency is the product of charging efficiency and discharging efficiency. The model must use round-trip efficiency to calculate arbitrage savings and, in some cases, DR energy requirements. Efficiency reduces delivered energy and directly impacts economics.\n\nTypical sources of losses: Inverter conversion DC cabling Internal resistance Cooling systems Power control system inefficiencies\n\nThe model must not assume constant efficiency. For example, LFP batteries often peak at 94 percent at moderate C-rates but fall to 85 percent during high C-rate discharge or low temperatures.\n\n2.5 Charge Constraints Charging limits may be lower than discharging limits. Many batteries restrict charging to 0.5C even if discharging can be 1C. AI must check manufacturer charge limits before modeling arbitrage that requires full recharge within off-peak windows.\n\n2.6 Inverter Rating and Derating Inverter rating is a hard limit on power. The model must always use AC-side inverter power when calculating peak shaving and DR capacity.\n\nInverters also derate due to: Temperature Altitude Voltage limits Overload protection\n\nIn extreme heat, a 100 kW inverter may be limited to 80 kW.\n\nThe model must apply derating rules when environmental data is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL\n\nPART 2 — EXTENDED ENGINEERING CONTENT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 3 — C-RATE, DISCHARGE DURATION, AND PHYSICS (EXTENDED)\n\n3.1 Formal Definition of C-Rate C-rate is the ratio of a battery’s discharge power to its energy capacity. C-rate determines how quickly a battery would fully discharge if it maintained rated power for the entire time.\n\nC-rate = Power_kW / Energy_kWh\n\nIf P is discharge power and E is usable energy, the theoretical discharge time (ignoring losses) is:\n\nDuration_hours = E / P Duration_hours = 1 / C\n\n3.2 Derivation from First Principles Consider a battery with energy density U (Wh) and a discharge rate I (A). Power is P = V × I Energy is E = V × Q\n\nC-rate is defined at the cell level as:\n\nC = I / Q\n\nMapping cell-level C to system-level C requires pack-level voltage and capacity normalization. For AI purposes, system-level C is sufficient.\n\n3.3 Why C-Rate Determines Applicability Battery applications have fundamentally different constraints: Arbitrage: Requires sustained multi-hour discharge Peak Shaving: Requires fast ramp AND 1–2 hours of output DR: Requires sustained output with recovery time UPS: Requires extremely high C-rate for seconds-long output\n\n3.4 AI Rules Governing C-Rate AI must enforce these rules:\n\nRule 1: If duration < peak-event duration → penalize or reject battery Rule 2: If C-rate > OEM warranty max → reject battery Rule 3: If C-rate < minimum required for use-case → reject battery Rule 4: If inverter_kW < battery power → use inverter_kW for C-rate Rule 5: If temperature derating applies → adjust C-rate downward Rule 6: Always recompute C-rate using usable energy, not nominal energy\n\n3.5 Typical Manufacturer C-Rate Limits LFP: Charge: 0.5C Discharge: 1.0C\n\nNMC: Charge: 0.3C–0.5C Discharge: 0.75C–1.25C\n\n3.6 Degradation Impact of C-Rate Cycle life decreases approximately exponentially with increasing C-rate:\n\nLife_fraction ≈ exp(−k × (C_rate / C_nominal))\n\nWhere k ≈ 1.0–1.5 for most chemistries.\n\n3.7 Real-World C-Rate Constraints Batteries may advertise 1C capability, but real operational limits reduce this: Thermal derating at high ambient temperature Voltage sag under high current Inverter current limits PCS firmware caps DoD and SOC window enforcement\n\nAI must factor these.\n\n\n\nSECTION 4 — PEAK DEMAND SHAVING ENGINE (EXTENDED)\n\n4.1 Identifying True Peak Demand Peak demand is the highest measured demand interval in a billing cycle.\n\nPeakDemand = max(interval_kW)\n\nAI must: Ignore anomalous single-interval spikes Identify multi-hour plateau peaks Determine whether the peak is HVAC-driven, process-driven, or random\n\n4.2 Peak Event Segmentation To model shaving, AI must identify the “peak event window” — the contiguous time span around the max demand during which demand exceeds a threshold (e.g., 90% of the peak).\n\nEventWindow = intervals where kW >= 0.9 × PeakDemand\n\nThis gives event duration: EventDuration = length(EventWindow)\n\n4.3 Peak Shaving Algorithm Given battery_kW and battery_kWh:\n\nMaxReduction_kW = min(battery_kW, inverter_kW) MaxPossibleDuration = battery_kWh / MaxReduction_kW\n\nIf MaxPossibleDuration >= EventDuration: EffectiveReduction = MaxReduction_kW Else EffectiveReduction = battery_kWh / EventDuration\n\n4.4 Annual Demand Savings Formula DemandSavings = EffectiveReduction × DemandCharge × 12\n\nDemandCharge may have: Non-coincident component On-peak component Seasonal component\n\nAI must always select the applicable demand charge for the peak period.\n\n4.5 Edge Cases Case: Peak event lasts 3 hours; duration = 2 hours → AI must proportionally reduce savings\n\nCase: Battery discharge capped at inverter → Use inverter_kW\n\nCase: Two peaks of equal size → Only the highest month matters → But AI should warn if modeling uncertainty exists\n\nCase: Negative battery savings due to DR reservation → AI must detect conflicts between DR and peak shaving\n\n4.6 AI Guardrails Guardrail 1: Never produce “peak”, “part-peak”, and “off-peak” demand savings. Demand is one number. Guardrail 2: Never assume spike-shaving is sustainable. Guardrail 3: Always validate shaving duration. Guardrail 4: Document any assumptions imposed due to missing interval data.\n\n\n\nSECTION 5 — ARBITRAGE ENGINE (EXTENDED)\n\n5.1 Time-of-Use Arbitrage Prerequisites Arbitrage requires price spread > 0: Spread = PeakRate − OffPeakRate If Spread <= 0: ArbitrageSavings = 0\n\nAI must not rely on part-peak arbitrage unless user explicitly requests it.\n\n5.2 Charging Constraint Battery must recharge during off-peak window.\n\nEnergyRequiredForNextDay = RawDailyDischarge ChargeCapacity = InverterLimit × OffPeakHours\n\nIf ChargeCapacity < EnergyRequired: DailyDischarge = ChargeCapacity × Efficiency\n\n5.3 Daily Discharge Computation RawDailyDischarge = min(batt_kW × ArbitrageHours, batt_kWh)\n\nDeliveredEnergy = RawDailyDischarge × RoundTripEfficiency\n\n5.4 Annual Arbitrage AnnualDischarge_kWh = DeliveredEnergy × 365 AnnualArbitrageSavings = AnnualDischarge_kWh × Spread\n\n5.5 Multi-Period Arbitrage AI should only use: Off-peak charge On-peak discharge\n\nPart-peak should only be used if TOU structure requires it.\n\n5.6 AI Guardrails Guardrail: Never triple-count arbitrage across peak, part-peak, off-peak. Guardrail: Arbitrage only occurs once per day unless user specifies multi-cycle mode. Guardrail: AI must check DR conflicts.\n\n\n\nSTOP HERE This is ~20% of the full-length manual, and now includes far more depth, math, and reasoning.\n\nBelow is PART 3 of the Battery Modeling & Sizing Manual — now written as if it is an engineering textbook + NREL whitepaper + utility DR implementer handbook + AI rulebook all combined, in pure raw text, no formatting, no markdown, sectioned for AI ingestion, and massively expanded.\n\nThis section will cover:\n\n• Full DR mathematical modeling • Complete degradation + lifetime modeling • More detailed C-rate physics • Multi-period demand modeling • Full dispatch logic • Warranty logic • DR program rules • Mathematical derivations • Optimization and AI rules • Failure conditions • Real-world examples\n\nThis is extremely long, deep, and technical — exactly what you asked for.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– BATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL PART 3 — C-RATE EXTENDED + DEGRADATION + DR ENGINE RAW STRUCTURED TEXT ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nSECTION 6 — EXTENDED PHYSICS OF C-RATE, HEAT GENERATION, VOLTAGE SAG, AND RAMP PERFORMANCE\n\n6.1 Internal Resistance and Voltage Sag When a battery discharges at high current, terminal voltage decreases due to internal resistance. Voltage = OpenCircuitVoltage − InternalResistance * Current\n\nBecause power equals voltage multiplied by current, high C-rates reduce effective AC output. AI must consider that real delivered kW may be lower than nameplate power when: C-rate exceeds 1 Battery is cold Battery is near maximum or minimum SOC Voltage derating is imposed\n\n6.2 Thermal Rise from High C-Rate Heat generation is proportional to current squared multiplied by internal resistance: Heat = I^2 * R\n\nHigh C-rate increases current linearly but increases heat quadratically. Batteries surpass thermal limits at high C-rates, triggering automatic derating. AI must model thermal derating when: Ambient temperature exceeds 35°C Battery cabinet is in poor ventilation Battery performs multiple cycles per day\n\n6.3 Ramp Rate Requirements Some applications (demand response, grid services, UPS) require fast ramp. RampRate = dP/dt\n\nBattery ramp rate limited by: Inverter current PCS firmware Grid code requirements Cell chemistry limitations\n\nAI must not model DR participation if ramp rate < required program ramp rate.\n\n6.4 SOC Window Requirements Batteries often operate only within a specific state of charge window. For example: Minimum SOC = 10% Maximum SOC = 90% Usable SOC window = 80% of nameplate energy\n\nAI must always enforce SOC windows during charging and discharging.\n\n6.5 C-Rate Impact on Efficiency At higher C-rates, round-trip efficiency decreases. Approximation used in modeling: Efficiency(C) = BaseEff − (C − 0.5)/10\n\nWhere BaseEff = 0.92 for LFP and 0.88 for NMC. AI must penalize arbitrage savings when discharge C-rate > 0.75.\n\n6.6 Mathematical Validation Checks for AI Check 1: If C > 2, reject operation Check 2: If thermal_rise > OEM_max_temp, derate battery_kW Check 3: If voltage_sag causes inverter clipping, reduce AC_kW Check 4: If SOC_window < required discharge, reject event modeling\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 7 — DEGRADATION, LIFETIME MODELING, AND WARRANTY LOGIC (EXTENDED)\n\n7.1 Two Types of Battery Degradation Calendar aging: time-based reduction in capacity Cycle aging: usage-based reduction in capacity\n\nAI must track both.\n\n7.2 Calendar Aging Model Annual calendar degradation typically ranges from 1.0% to 2.5% per year. DegradationCalendar = k_calendar * Years Where k_calendar ≈ 0.015 for LFP\n\n7.3 Cycle Aging Model Cycle aging depends on depth of discharge (DoD). Common empirical relationship: DegradationCycle = k_cycle * (DoD)^α\n\nα ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 depending on chemistry. k_cycle based on cycle count rating.\n\nExample: If cell is rated for 6000 cycles at 80% DoD: k_cycle = 1 / 6000 AI must compute degraded capacity after n cycles.\n\n7.4 Effective Battery Capacity Over Time EffectiveCapacity(year) = NominalCapacity * (1 − DegradationCalendar − DegradationCycle)\n\nAI must use degraded capacity for annual savings, not initial capacity.\n\n7.5 Warranty Enforcement Rules AI must reject scenarios where: CyclesPerYear > WarrantyCyclesPerYear C-rate > OEM maximum Average temperature > warranty temperature DoD exceeds warranty DoD limit\n\n7.6 Battery Replacement Modeling For long-term NPV, the battery may need replacement after useful life. AI must incorporate mid-life replacement if analysis horizon > expected life.\n\n7.7 Real-World Considerations Peak shaving uses fewer cycles than arbitrage; arbitrage-heavy models degrade faster. DR participation can cause deeper cycles, shortening life. AI must identify the dominant degradation mechanism for each use-case.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 8 — DEMAND RESPONSE MODELING (EXTENDED)\n\n8.1 Types of DR Programs There are multiple forms of DR programs: Day-Ahead DR Real-Time DR Capacity Bidding Emergency Load Reduction Ancillary services DR Fast Frequency Response\n\nAI must differentiate between them.\n\n8.2 DR Requirements Breakdown Each DR program has: Event duration Event frequency per year Ramp rate requirements Notification time Sustained output requirements Reset/Recovery requirements For example: A DR program may require: Sustain 100 kW for 4 hours Up to 20 events per year 10-minute response time\n\nAI must check ALL requirements.\n\n8.3 DR Mathematical Eligibility Battery must satisfy: Power requirement: Battery_kW >= DR_committed_kW\n\nDuration requirement: Battery_kWh / DR_committed_kW >= DR_event_duration\n\nRecovery requirement: Available_offpeak_hours * ChargePower >= energy_depleted\n\nAI must reject DR participation when any requirement is violated.\n\n8.4 DR Revenue Model DRRevenue = CommittedKW * EventHours * EventCount * ProgramRate If DR is capacity-based, AI must add monthly or annual payments independent of events: DRCapacityPayment = CommittedKW * CapacityRate * Months\n\n8.5 Interaction Between DR and Arbitrage Arbitrage revenue and DR revenue may conflict because: Battery must reserve SOC for DR event periods Battery cannot be simultaneously dispatched for shaving and arbitrage AI must decide optimal dispatch strategy based on user goals.\n\n8.6 DR Priority Logic If goal = maximize DR revenue: Reserve SOC for DR Reduce arbitrage cycles\n\nIf goal = maximize bill savings: Prioritize demand shaving + arbitrage Allow DR only if non-conflicting\n\n8.7 Multi-Cycle DR Events If program has two events per day: Battery must recharge between events AI must enforce inter-event recharge feasibility.\n\n8.8 Fast Response DR Fast-acting DR requires: Ramp < 1 second C-rate > 2 In practice, most C&I batteries are not eligible AI must warn and automatically mark “Not Eligible”.\n\n8.9 Real-World DR Mistakes AI Must Avoid Do not assume DR events last 15 minutes Do not assume arbitrary number of events Do not assume unlimited recharge capability Do not assume arbitrage is possible on same day as DR event Do not assume events occur in off-peak windows\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 9 — BATTERY DISPATCH ALGORITHMS (FULL LOGIC)\n\n9.1 Time-Series Dispatch for Peak Shaving At each interval t: If interval_kW > TargetPeak: Discharge = min(Battery_kW, interval_kW − TargetPeak) SOC = SOC − Discharge * interval_duration Stop discharging when SOC_window limit reached\n\n9.2 Time-Series Dispatch for Arbitrage Charge during lowest-priced periods until SOC max Discharge during highest-priced periods until SOC min AI must enforce hourly constraints\n\n9.3 Dispatch for DR Upon DR notification: Instantly reserve energy equal to: DR_committed_kW * DR_event_duration and halt all arbitrage until event ends\n\n9.4 Conflict Resolution Priority = user goal If goal is DR → DR > shaving > arbitrage If goal is shaving → shaving > DR > arbitrage If goal is ROI → maximize total annual benefit via optimization loop\n\n9.5 Optimization Loop For each battery in library: Simulate peak shaving Simulate arbitrage Simulate DR Compute net benefit Select battery that maximizes user objective\n\n9.6 Multi-Day Simulation Window AI must ensure battery ends each day with acceptable SOC for next-day events.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 10 — EXTENDED FINANCIAL MODELING (coming next in Part 4 if you confirm)\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nTHIS IS ONLY PART 3. We have many sections left, for a full 60-page manual.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nTO CONTINUE TO PART 4 (SECTIONS 10–12, extended financial modeling, multi-use stacking, full optimization math):\n\nReply: Continue\n\nIf you want even MORE depth before moving on, reply: More detail before continuing\n\nYou said:\n\ncontinue\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nExport Message as PDF\n\nExcellent — continuing with PART 4 of the Battery Modeling & Sizing Manual. This section is deep engineering, heavy math, full financial logic, multi-use stacking rules, and AI behavioral constraints. Still raw text, structured, with no styling.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL\n\nPART 4 — EXTENDED FINANCIAL MODELING + MULTI-USE STACKING\n\nRAW STRUCTURED TEXT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — EXTENDED FINANCIAL MODELING (NPV, IRR, PAYBACK, SGIP, CEFO, OBF)\n\n10.1 Purpose of Financial Modeling The purpose of the financial model is to convert technical performance into economic outcomes. The financial model must translate battery dispatch into annual dollar savings, incentive value, capital cost, and long-term profitability metrics. The financial model provides decision-grade information for project scoping, proposal creation, and multi-measure optimization.\n\n10.2 Core Financial Metrics The model calculates the following:\n\nAnnual demand savings Annual arbitrage savings Annual DR revenue Annual maintenance cost Annual net savings Simple payback Net present value (NPV) Internal rate of return (IRR) Levelized cost of energy storage (LCOS) CEFO or OBF loan eligibility SGIP incentive value\n\n10.3 Capital Cost (CAPEX) CAPEX includes:\n\nBattery modules Inverter and PCS Switchgear Transformer or service upgrades Installation labor Engineering Permitting Sales tax Commissioning Controls and EMS\n\nThe model must allow CAPEX to be reduced by incentives when rules permit.\n\n10.4 Annual Operating Expenses (OPEX) Opex includes:\n\nAnnual maintenance contract EMS software licensing Warranty extension if required Insurance Performance testing Cyclical cost adjustments\n\nAI must assume O&M cost is non-zero unless explicitly set to zero.\n\n10.5 Annual Net Savings Annual net savings equal:\n\nNetAnnualSavings = DemandSavings + ArbitrageSavings + DRRevenue − AnnualOandM\n\nAI must prevent negative net savings unless intentionally modeling a poor asset.\n\n10.6 Simple Payback Calculation SimplePayback = CAPEX / NetAnnualSavings AI must guard against:\n\nZero division errors NetAnnualSavings < 0 Reporting negative payback\n\n10.7 Time Value of Money When calculating NPV, cashflow discounting must be applied:\n\nNPV = −CAPEX + sum(NetAnnualSavings / (1 + discount_rate)^t)\n\nAI must allow user-adjustable discount rates.\n\n10.8 IRR Calculation IRR is the discount rate where NPV equals zero.\n\nAI must not attempt symbolic derivation; instead use:\n\nNewton-Raphson iterative approximation Bisection search Or internal function if provided\n\n10.9 Lifecycle Replacement Modeling If analysis horizon exceeds battery life, replacement cost must be modeled:\n\nReplacementYear = expected_lifetime ReplacementCost = CAPEX * replacement_fraction DiscountedReplacementCost = ReplacementCost / (1 + discount_rate)^ReplacementYear\n\n10.10 Salvage Value If battery life extends beyond analysis period, salvage value may be included:\n\nSalvageValue = RemainingValue / (1 + discount_rate)^analysis_years AI must not overstate salvage value.\n\n10.11 Fuel Adjustment Logic If the battery reduces gas heating demand (through HVAC controls interaction), therms savings must be included. AI must use proper rates for therms.\n\n10.12 Multi-Tariff Adjustment If the battery changes the customer’s tariff (for example, qualifying for a lower demand charge), AI must calculate:\n\nOldBill NewBill Savings = OldBill − NewBill\n\nTariff migration is one of the strongest value drivers.\n\n10.13 SGIP Incentive Modeling SGIP includes:\n\nBase incentive Equity resiliency adder Large storage step-downs Discharge cycling bonus\n\nAI must calculate:\n\nSGIPIncentive = kWh * incentive_rate Adjusted for:\n\nStep number Equity eligibility Maximum cap rules Operating profile\n\n10.14 CEFO / OBF Loan Modeling AI must enforce:\n\nCreditCheckPass SimplePayback <= program maximum MaxTerm <= program limit CAPEX < program cap\n\nLoan payment formula:\n\nPayment = CAPEX * (r / (1 − (1 + r)^(−TermMonths)))\n\n10.15 AI Guardrails for Finance AI must check:\n\nIf DR revenue > theoretical maximum → error If TWh-level savings appear → error If NPV extremely large → check inputs If arbitrage savings exceed cycle capability → adjust If battery cycles per year exceed warranty → warn or reject\n\n\n\nSECTION 11 — MULTI-USE STACKING, INTERACTION, AND PRIORITY RULES\n\n11.1 Purpose Multi-use stacking allows a battery to perform multiple value streams simultaneously. However, improper stacking can double-count savings or violate technical constraints.\n\n11.2 Value Streams That Can Be Stacked Demand shaving Arbitrage Demand response Backup power (not monetized but affects sizing) Solar clipping Tariff optimization\n\n11.3 Mutual Exclusivity Rules AI must enforce:\n\nDemand shaving and arbitrage can coexist DR and arbitrage conflict during event days Demand shaving and DR can coexist if event does not overlap peak Backup power reduces available SOC window for other uses Solar clipping coexists with most functions\n\n11.4 Priority Assignment Priority = user goal\n\nIf user goal = maximize ROI: 1 arbitrage 2 demand shaving 3 DR\n\nIf goal = maximize demand shaving: 1 demand shaving 2 arbitrage 3 DR\n\nIf goal = maximize DR revenue: 1 DR 2 peak shaving 3 arbitrage\n\nThese determine SOC reserve strategy.\n\n11.5 Dispatch Coordination At each time interval:\n\nStep 1: Check DR event Step 2: Check peak shaving requirements Step 3: Check arbitrage opportunity Step 4: Maintain SOC window\n\n11.6 SOC Reserve Logic If DR window is predicted: Reserve energy equal to DR_duration * DR_committed_kW\n\n11.7 Multi-Day Optimization AI must check:\n\nBattery ends each day with SOC sufficient for next day Peak events do not occur immediately after long DR events\n\n11.8 Stacking Failure Cases Case: DR event requires 4 hours at 200 kW but battery is 200 kW / 200 kWh Case: Arbitrage cycle leaves battery empty during peak Case: Overlapping DR and peak shaving windows Case: Weekly event schedule exceeds weekly recharge capacity\n\nAI must detect these scenarios and choose:\n\nReject stacking scenario Resize battery Change dispatch priority\n\n\n\nSECTION 12 — MATHEMATICAL DERIVATIONS FOR MODELING\n\n12.1 Peak Shaving Derivation Given interval demand d(t), target peak T, battery discharge P_batt, duration D, and SOC:\n\nIf d(t) > T: P_shave(t) = min(P_batt, d(t) − T)\n\nCumulative energy needed for event: E_event = sum(P_shave(t) * Δt)\n\nBattery must satisfy: E_event <= usable_energy\n\nIf not: Scale P_shave(t) downward uniformly.\n\n12.2 Arbitrage Derivation Let price schedule be p(t), off_peak_price = p_low, peak_price = p_high.\n\nBattery charges during t where price = p_low. Battery discharges during t where price = p_high.\n\nEnergy delivered: E_del = min(P_batt * H_high, usable_energy) * efficiency\n\nAnnual arbitrage savings: S_arbitrage = E_del * 365 * (p_high − p_low)\n\n12.3 DR Derivation Event revenue: R = P_commit * H_event * N_events * rate_event\n\nEligibility requires: usable_energy >= P_commit * H_event recharge_feasible = (charge_hours * charge_power) >= (P_commit * H_event)\n\n12.4 Optimization Problem Let V(battery) = NPV(battery)\n\nUser goal transforms into: Select battery b in library such that: b* = argmax V(b)\n\nSubject to constraints: C_rate_limit duration_limit discount_rate loan eligibility incentive eligibility\n\nThis is a bounded discrete optimization problem.\n\n12.5 Battery Lifetime Derivation If cycle degradation = f(DoD), then after n cycles: Capacity_n = Capacity_0 * (1 − sum(f(DoD_i))) − calendar_degradation\n\n12.6 Efficiency as Function of C Efficiency(C) = η0 − α*(C − C_ref)^2 Where α determined empirically. AI must use η0 = base efficiency and C_ref = mid C-rate.\n\n\n\nSECTION 13 — REAL-WORLD WORKED EXAMPLES (EXTENDED)\n\n13.1 Hospital with 400 kW Peak Battery options: 100 kW / 400 kWh, 200 kW / 600 kWh Demand charge = 25 per kW-month Arbitrage spread = 0.15 DR event = 3 hours, 10 events/year, 8 dollars per kW-event\n\nCompute: Peak shaving Arbitrage DR NPV IRR Payback Cycle life Warrantable operation\n\n13.2 Industrial Facility with Long Peaks Peaks last 2 to 3 hours, seldom below 1 hour. Batteries under 1C insufficient. AI must resize batteries accordingly.\n\n13.3 School with Low Afternoon Peaks Smaller batteries may achieve similar savings. AI must detect diminishing returns.\n\n13.4 Office Building with Zero Arbitrage Spread Arbitrage automatically disabled. Peak shaving dominates.\n\n\n\nSECTION 14 — VALIDATION TEST SUITE\n\nTest 1: Oversized battery must be rejected Test 2: Undersized battery must be penalized Test 3: Arbitrage-only scenarios must show zero demand savings Test 4: DR-only scenarios must show zero arbitrage Test 5: Duration violation must reduce savings Test 6: C-rate > 2 must generate error Test 7: Charge window insufficient must reduce performance Test 8: Inverter limit must cap battery_kW Test 9: Thermal limit must reduce battery_kW Test 10: Round-trip efficiency must reduce arbitrage savings\n\n\n\nSECTION 15 — AI BEHAVIOR AND GUARDRAILS\n\nAI must: Always enforce physics. Never hallucinate battery capability. Never produce impossible savings. Never double-count. Always respect SOC windows. Always report assumptions. Always disclose uncertainty. Always request missing inputs. Always run constraint checks. Always verify duration. Reject DR participation if ramp or duration invalid. Reject arbitrage if spread <= 0. Reject peak shaving if event cannot be sustained. Reject modeling when inputs violate warranty.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nContinuing PDF #1 — Battery Modeling & Sizing Manual PART 5 — Battery Safety, Thermal Modeling, EMS Logic (Structured raw text, extremely detailed, no formatting, no markdown)\n\nI will keep expanding the document at the same level of depth and length. This section now dives into: • Battery safety physics • Thermal limits • BMS and EMS logic • SOC window enforcement • Fire protection • Fault modes • Operating envelopes • Advanced dispatch behavior\n\nThis is all raw text for your PDF.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– BATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL PART 5 — SAFETY, THERMAL MODELING, AND EMS LOGIC RAW STRUCTURED TEXT –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nSECTION 16 — SAFETY AND THERMAL MODELING\n\n16.1 Purpose of Safety Modeling Battery systems operate under chemical, electrical, and thermal constraints. Safety models are crucial for ensuring that the AI never suggests operating parameters that violate physical, chemical, manufacturer, or code limitations. Safety modeling protects against fire risk, thermal runaway, overcurrent conditions, and inverter overload.\n\n16.2 Thermal Runaway Basics Thermal runaway is a condition where heat generation exceeds heat dissipation, causing exponential temperature rise. It is triggered by: Internal short circuits Overcharging Excessive discharge current Mechanical penetration Manufacturing defects Elevated ambient temperatures\n\nAI must never propose operating conditions that risk thermal runaway. Batteries must stay within the temperature envelopes stated by the manufacturer.\n\n16.3 Temperature Operating Ranges Typical LFP operating range: Discharge: −20C to +55C Charge: 0C to +55C Optimal performance: 15C to 35C\n\nCharging below freezing causes lithium plating. Discharging above 55C accelerates degradation.\n\n16.4 Thermal Derating Battery inverters and PCS systems derate power based on temperature. Derating usually begins around 35C and becomes severe above 45C. AI must reduce effective battery power when ambient temperatures exceed thresholds.\n\n16.5 Cooling Requirements Forced air cooling or liquid cooling systems maintain cell temperature. If cooling capacity is insufficient, battery output is reduced. AI must check if cooling power is adequate for high C-rates.\n\n16.6 Chemical Stability LFP batteries are more stable than NMC and less prone to fire propagation. AI must identify chemistry type if known and adjust risk factors accordingly.\n\n16.7 Safety Certification Rules AI must assume all batteries must comply with: UL 9540 UL 9540A NFPA 855 IEEE 1547 Local jurisdiction fire code spacing and ventilation\n\nEven in modeling, AI cannot ignore these constraints when suggesting equipment.\n\n16.8 Heat Generation Model Heat = I^2 * R_internal Where I = current, R_internal = internal resistance.\n\nAI must model thermal rise for high C-rate operations and reduce battery power if thermal model predicts overheating.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 17 — STATE OF CHARGE (SOC) WINDOW AND CONTROL LOGIC\n\n17.1 SOC Window Definition Batteries operate within a SOC window that protects cell health. Example: Minimum SOC = 10 percent Maximum SOC = 90 percent Usable SOC window = 80 percent\n\n17.2 SOC Window Enforcement AI must never allow discharge outside the SOC window. If SOC hits min level, discharge ends. If SOC hits max level, charging stops.\n\n17.3 SOC Buffering for DR When DR is expected, AI must reserve SOC equal to: Reserve_kWh = DR_committed_kW * DR_duration\n\n17.4 SOC Buffering for Peak Shaving AI must ensure the battery has enough stored energy to cover the next expected peak event. If not, arbitrage cycles must be reduced.\n\n17.5 SOC Reset Logic After DR events or deep cycles, battery must return to neutral SOC. Recharge feasibility must be checked based on: Available charging hours Charge power limits Off peak tariff windows Grid constraints\n\n17.6 Long-Term SOC Behavior Frequently operating at low or high SOC accelerates degradation. AI must avoid: Keeping SOC < 20 percent for long durations Keeping SOC > 80 percent for long durations Repeated heavy cycling without rest periods\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 18 — BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (BMS) LOGIC\n\n18.1 What the BMS Does The BMS monitors and controls: Cell voltages Cell temperatures Current flow SOC calculation Balancing Fault detection Overcharge protection Over-discharge protection Thermal management\n\nAI must assume all BMS protections are active and override aggressive dispatch profiles.\n\n18.2 Overcurrent Protection Battery cannot exceed manufacturer-defined current. AI must compute: MaxCurrent = P_max / V_nominal If modeled current > MaxCurrent, reduce discharge.\n\n18.3 Cell Balancing Behavior Balancing makes top-of-charge slower and reduces effective usable capacity at high SOC. AI must account for decreased charge rate near the SOC ceiling.\n\n18.4 Fault Modes The BMS will shut down the battery for: Overvoltage Undervoltage Overcurrent Overtemperature Undertemperature Cell imbalance Isolation fault Communication failure AI must reduce or stop modeling for faulty conditions.\n\n18.5 String and Module Limitations If battery consists of parallel strings: Each string must stay within its voltage and thermal window. AI must avoid uneven load distribution.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 19 — ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMS) DISPATCH LOGIC\n\n19.1 Purpose of EMS The EMS orchestrates battery dispatch across multiple goals. AI must emulate the behavior of EMS systems used in real facilities.\n\n19.2 EMS Dispatch Hierarchy Dispatch priority depends on user-selected goal.\n\nFor ROI mode: 1 Arbitrage 2 Peak shaving 3 DR\n\nFor demand reduction mode: 1 Peak shaving 2 DR 3 Arbitrage\n\nFor DR revenue mode: 1 DR 2 Peak shaving 3 Arbitrage\n\n19.3 Look-Ahead Logic EMS predicts load and rates using: Historical data Weather Schedule Utility pricing AI must implement basic predictive logic.\n\n19.4 Dispatch Algorithm Loop For each interval: Check DR schedule Check peak condition Check arbitrage window Check SOC limits Dispatch accordingly Update SOC Adjust next interval instructions\n\n19.5 Dispatch Safeguards Battery cannot: Discharge twice in one period Charge while peak shaving Discharge when DR reserve required Charge beyond limits Exceed SOC window Violate thermal constraints\n\n19.6 Event Clustering EMS must detect clustered peaks (multiple peaks in close succession) and choose which peaks to shave.\n\n19.7 Demand Spike Identification Spikes lasting only one interval should be ignored or treated differently than sustained peaks.\n\n19.8 EMS Fail-Safe Logic If the model predicts insufficient energy for next event, EMS configures battery to reduce arbitrage cycles.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– SECTION 20 — BATTERY SAFETY AND CODE COMPLIANCE\n\n20.1 Fire Code Separation Distances AI must assume standard separation rules: 3 feet minimum between cabinets 24 feet from building openings (varies by jurisdiction) Dedicated fire suppression required\n\n20.2 Hazard Mitigation Fire detection Thermal runaway detection Manual disconnects Smoke dampers\n\n20.3 AI Constraints AI must not propose: Batteries installed in unsafe locations Operations that violate UL or NFPA standards Non-warrantable operation\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL\n\nPART 6 — OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 21 — OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVES\n\n21.1 Purpose of Optimization Battery systems can be optimized for different user-defined goals. The AI must determine which goal applies and adjust modeling priorities accordingly. Optimization is not merely selecting the highest NPV; it may involve: Maximizing demand shaving Maximizing arbitrage profit Maximizing DR revenue Qualifying for incentives Meeting a payback target Meeting backup power requirements Minimizing capital cost Minimizing battery size Balancing multiple value streams simultaneously\n\n21.2 Supported Optimization Goals Goal 1: Maximize NPV Goal 2: Maximize net annual savings Goal 3: Minimize simple payback Goal 4: Maximize DR revenue Goal 5: Maximize demand charge reduction Goal 6: Minimize battery size that meets performance Goal 7: Qualify for incentive program Goal 8: Meet a required peak reduction Goal 9: Provide limited backup power Goal 10: Provide solar-self consumption optimization\n\nAI must map user statements to one of these.\n\n21.3 Multi-Objective Optimization When goals conflict, AI must use weighted scoring. For example: TotalScore = α * NPV + β * PeakReduction + γ * DRRevenue Where α, β, γ are goal-dependent weights.\n\nExamples: If user goal = DR → γ high If user goal = payback → α and β dominate If user wants smallest capex → size penalty applies\n\n21.4 Optimizing Over a Battery Library For each battery in the library: Simulate peak shaving Simulate arbitrage Simulate DR Simulate degradation Calculate financial metrics Apply constraints Score battery Pick highest scoring battery\n\n21.5 Dominance Rules Battery A dominates Battery B if: A has higher net present value A meets all technical constraints B meets A costs less or equal A meets user’s goal better than B\n\nAI must automatically eliminate dominated options.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBATTERY MODELING AND SIZING MANUAL\n\nPART 7 — DISPATCH SIMULATION & TIME-SERIES MODEL\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 22 — DISPATCH SIMULATION LOGIC\n\n22.1 Purpose Real-world batteries operate in time-series.

No arbitrage allowed. No peak shaving allowed (unless user goal requires it). Transmission losses must be included.\n\n22.7 Backup Mode When Required If battery reserved for backup: SOC must be raised to target backup SOC each day.

These constraints must be respected by any engineering model, dispatch strategy, or optimization engine. Technical constraints exist to prevent:\n\nOverloading Overheating Overvoltage Undervoltage Exceeding warranty limits Accelerated degradation Safety hazards Invalid modeling physics\n\nAn AI energy modeling engine must implement all constraints deterministically and must never allow exceptions.\n\n1.2 Constraint Categories This manual organizes battery constraints into eight primary categories:\n\nInverter-limited constraints\n\nCell chemistry constraints\n\nThermal constraints\n\nVoltage and current constraints\n\nSOC window constraints\n\nDepth of discharge constraints\n\nManufacturer warranty constraints\n\nGrid-code and safety constraints\n\n1.3 Constraint Enforcement Hierarchy The AI must enforce constraints in the following order:\n\nLevel 1: Safety constraints Level 2: Manufacturer constraints Level 3: Thermal constraints Level 4: Inverter constraints Level 5: Chemistry constraints Level 6: Warranty constraints Level 7: Economic optimization\n\nNothing overrides safety or manufacturer constraints, regardless of economic benefit.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2 — INVERTER-LIMITED CONSTRAINTS (DERIVATION)\n\n2.1 Inverter as the Primary AC-Side Constraint A battery’s inverter converts DC energy into AC power. The inverter generally becomes the dominant limit on power output, even when the battery pack could theoretically provide more.\n\nLet: P_batt = DC-side maximum discharge capability P_inv = AC inverter rating P_AC = actual delivered AC power\n\nThe constraint is: P_AC = min(P_batt, P_inv)\n\n2.2 Inverter Clipping Inverter clipping occurs when battery DC-side power exceeds inverter AC-side rating.\n\nIf P_batt > P_inv: ClippingLoss = P_batt − P_inv EnergyDelivered = P_inv × duration\n\nThis means adding more DC battery modules does not increase AC power if inverter is undersized.\n\nAI must detect and prevent overvaluation of oversized DC energy.\n\n2.3 Inverter Efficiency Inverters have conversion efficiency: η_inv ≈ 0.96−0.99 depending on load.\n\nActual AC output: P_AC = P_DC × η_inv\n\n2.4 Partial Load Efficiency Curve Inverter efficiency drops at low loading. Typical curve:\n\nη_inv(P) = η_max − α(1 − P/P_inv)^2\n\nWhere α ~ 0.04 for many systems.\n\nAI must reduce arbitrage savings when battery frequently operates at low AC loading.\n\n2.5 Inverter Overload Capability Some inverters support short-duration overload (e.g., 110 percent for 10 seconds). AI must not misuse this for peak shaving or DR modeling.\n\nOverload is for fault ride-through only.\n\n\n\nSECTION 3 — CELL CHEMISTRY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL LIMITS\n\n3.1 Nernst Equation and Cell Voltage Battery cell voltage is governed by: V = V0 + (RT/nF) ln(activities)\n\nDuring discharge: Voltage decreases as concentration gradient forms. High current accelerates voltage sag.\n\n3.2 Internal Resistance Each battery cell has internal resistance R_int. During discharge:\n\nV_actual = V_OCV − I × R_int Power delivered: P = V_actual × I\n\nAs current increases: Voltage sag increases Power efficiency decreases Heat increases as I^2 R losses\n\n3.3 Maximum Discharge Current Maximum current I_max is defined by chemistry.\n\nC-rate = I / Q Where Q is capacity in amp-hours.\n\nAI must compute: I_required = P_required / V_nominal If I_required > I_max → battery cannot supply required power.\n\n3.4 Charge Rate Limitations Charge rates are usually half of discharge rates for safety. Lithium plating risk increases dramatically below 0°C.\n\nAI must apply: If Temperature < 0°C → ChargeRate_max = 0 If 0 < Temperature < 10°C → ChargeRate_max ≤ 0.25C If Temperature > 35°C → Reduce ChargeRate_max by 10–30 percent\n\n3.5 Cell Balancing Constraints Cells in a pack must stay balanced within millivolts. When near 100 percent SOC, balancing circuits activate and reduce charge acceptance.\n\nAI must derate charging near SOC ceiling.\n\n\n\nSECTION 4 — THERMAL CONSTRAINTS (EXTENDED DERIVATION)\n\n4.1 Heat Generation Heat generated: Q = I^2 × R_internal × t\n\nHigher C-rate → higher heat → thermal risk.\n\nAI must compute predicted internal temperature rise: ΔT = Q / (m × Cp) Where: m = battery mass Cp = heat capacity\n\n4.2 Cooling System Limits Cooling power P_cool sets maximum sustainable C-rate.\n\nIf Q_gen > P_cool → derating required.\n\nAI must compute: MaxC_sustainable = sqrt(P_cool / (R_internal × V_nominal))\n\n4.3 Thermal Runaway Threshold Thermal runaway occurs when: dT/dt > heat dissipation rate\n\nAI must not operate near these thresholds.\n\n4.4 Ambient Temperature Constraints At high ambient temperatures: SOC window shrinks Charge rate shrinks Cycle life worsens Internal resistance increases\n\nAI must derate based on temperature.\n\n4.5 Thermal Degradation Equation Calendar degradation increases with temperature as Arrhenius relationship:\n\nk = A exp(−Ea / (RT))\n\nHigher T accelerates degradation.\n\nAI must model life reduction at high average temperatures.\n\n\n\nSECTION 5 — VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LIMITS\n\n5.1 Voltage Window Each chemistry has voltage operating window: LFP: ~2.5V to 3.65V per cell NMC: ~3.0V to 4.2V per cell\n\nDo NOT allow discharge past lower voltage. Do NOT allow charge beyond upper voltage.\n\nAI must enforce voltage cutoffs.\n\n5.2 Current Limits MaxCurrent = C_rate_max × Q\n\nIf required current > MaxCurrent: Power request must be reduced.\n\n5.3 Voltage Sag Model At high current: Voltage drops → reduces power → reduces arbitrage and shaving effectiveness.\n\nAI must compute: V_loaded = V_OCV − I × R_internal\n\nIf V_loaded < inverter_min_voltage → inverter trips.\n\n5.4 Cable and Busbar Constraints Current flowing through cables generates additional I^2R losses and heating.\n\nAI must enforce limits on wiring.\n\n\n\nSECTION 6 — SOC WINDOW CONSTRAINTS (DERIVED)\n\n6.1 SOC Limits Defined by Manufacturer SOC_min and SOC_max define allowable energy window.\n\nTypical values: SOC_min = 10 percent SOC_max = 90 percent Usable window = 80 percent\n\nAI must enforce: If SOC <= SOC_min → discharging stops If SOC >= SOC_max → charging stops\n\n6.2 Dynamic SOC Window Shrinkage At low temperatures, SOC_min increases. At high temperatures, SOC_max decreases.\n\nAI must compute adaptive SOC window.\n\n6.3 SOC Calculation SOC evolves based on: SOC_next = SOC_curr − (Power * Δt) / UsableEnergy\n\nAI must track SOC continuously.\n\n6.4 SOC Reserve for DR AI must reserve energy for DR events by ensuring: SOC >= Reserve_kWh / UsableEnergy\n\n6.5 SOC Hysteresis SOC boundaries have hysteresis to avoid oscillation.\n\n\n\nSECTION 7 — DEPTH OF DISCHARGE AND USABLE ENERGY\n\n7.1 DoD Definition Depth of Discharge = fraction of usable capacity consumed.\n\nDoD = ΔE / E_usable\n\n7.2 DoD and Lifetime Cycle life decreases as DoD increases.\n\nRelationship: Cycles(DoD) = k × DoD^(−α)\n\nWhere α ~ 1.2 for LFP and ~1.4 for NMC.\n\n7.3 Partial Cycling Partial cycles accumulate proportional wear: CycleEquivalent = sum(DoD_i)\n\nAI must compute cycle-equivalent usage.\n\n7.4 Usable Energy Reduction Over Time Use: E_usable(t) = E_initial × (1 − degradation(t))\n\nAI must adjust savings by year.\n\n\n\nSTOP HERE — this is the end of PART 1 of 4 for PDF #2.

Warranty violations result in voided support, accelerated failures, thermal risk, or unusable equipment. AI must enforce these constraints with zero tolerance.\n\n8.2 Warranty Operating Envelope Every battery has a documented warranty operating envelope. These define: Maximum discharge C-rate Maximum charge C-rate Allowed operating temperature range Maximum number of cycles per year Maximum depth of discharge Maximum average DoD Maximum ramp rates Maximum calendar years Retention requirement (e.g., 70 percent capacity at 10 years)\n\nAI must retrieve or infer these if unknown.\n\n8.3 Warranty Capacity Retention Curve Manufacturers state that battery capacity will degrade according to: CapacityRetention(t) = C_initial − (k_cal * t) − (k_cycle * CycleEquivalent(t))\n\nWhere: k_cal = calendar degradation rate k_cycle = cycle-based degradation rate\n\nCycleEquivalent is sum of DoD-weighted cycles.\n\n8.4 Calendar Degradation Derivation Calendar degradation follows Arrhenius dependence: k_cal(T) = A * exp(−Ea / (R_gas * T_abs))\n\nWhere: A = pre-exponential factor Ea = activation energy T_abs = absolute temperature R_gas = gas constant\n\nHigher temperature accelerates degradation.\n\n8.5 Cycle Degradation Derivation Battery lifetime decreases exponentially with DoD. Empirical relationship: Cycles(DoD) ≈ C0 * DoD^(−α)\n\nWhere α ~1.2–1.5 for Li-ion cells. AI must compute equivalent cycles as: CycleEquivalent = Σ(DoD_i)\n\n8.6 Total Lifetime Prediction RemainingLifeYears = min( CalendarLifeLimit, CycleLifeLimit )\n\nIf remaining life < analysis horizon, AI must include replacement cost.\n\n8.7 Warranty DoD Constraint If DoD > DoD_warranty_limit, operation is invalid. AI must cap usable energy at warranty DoD.\n\n8.8 Warranty Temperature Constraint If T < Tmin or T > Tmax, AI must reject the scenario. Warm climate or cold storage introduces derating or modification.\n\n8.9 Warranty Charge/Discharge Constraints If requested C-rate > warranty C-rate: AI must force derating or reject configuration.\n\n8.10 Warranty Cycle Limit per Year If cycles/year > maximum allowed: AI must throttle arbitrage cycles Reduce DR event participation Adjust savings downward\n\n8.11 Degradation-Cost Modeling DegradationCost = ReplacementCost / ExpectedCycleLife AI must subtract degradation costs from annual savings when needed.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 9 — ADVANCED DEGRADATION MODELING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.1 Two-Dimensional Degradation Matrix Degradation is a function of both DoD and temperature. AI must use 2D lookup model: Degradation(DoD, Temp) = f1(DoD) + f2(Temp) + interaction_term\n\nCycles degrade faster at high temperatures and high DoD.\n\n9.2 Rainflow Counting Method For irregular cycling profiles, the industry uses “rainflow counting” to extract cycle depths. AI must approximate: CycleEquivalent = sum(DoD_i extracted by rainflow) Even if using simplified methods, AI must not double-count cycles.\n\n9.3 Temperature-Dependent Cycle Life Cycle life scales with temperature using Arrhenius factor: CycleLife(T) = BaseLife * exp(−k*(T − T_ref))\n\n9.4 SOC-Dependent Degradation Leaving battery at high SOC increases degradation. AI must reduce arbitrage cycles if SOC window is frequently full.\n\n9.5 Accelerated Aging Scenarios AI must detect hazard scenarios: Repeated deep cycles High daily cycles Low-temperature charging High-temperature operation High C-rate operation Long-term storage at high SOC\n\n9.6 End-of-Life Definition EoL occurs when usable capacity reaches 70–80% of initial. AI must reduce economic benefits in late-life periods.\n\n9.7 Mid-Life Replacement If life < analysis horizon: AI must apply: ReplacementCost at year ReplacementYear Discounted properly Update new battery performance post-replacement\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — DEMAND RESPONSE TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.1 DR Technical Requirements Every DR program has unique technical constraints. Common parameters: Power commitment (kW) Event duration (hours) Event count per year Ramp time Notification time Refractory period between events Recharge requirement\n\nAI must enforce ALL constraints.\n\n10.2 DR Event Energy Requirement Required battery energy for event: E_req = P_commit * H_event\n\nAI must compare E_req to battery usable energy.\n\n10.3 Recharge Feasibility Batteries must recharge between events. RechargeEnergy = E_req RechargePower = ChargeLimit AvailableTime = OffPeakHours\n\nRecharge feasibility check: RechargePower * AvailableTime >= RechargeEnergy If false → DR participation is infeasible.\n\n10.4 SOC Reservation Strategy During DR windows, battery must maintain SOC high enough to satisfy event. If DR event at time t: SOC_min_required = E_req / E_usable\n\nAI must enforce SOC >= this threshold anytime before t.\n\n10.5 DR + Peak Shaving Conflict If DR event overlaps with facility peak: Battery cannot perform both at full power. AI must choose based on user’s priority goal.\n\n10.6 DR + Arbitrage Conflict If battery is dispatched for arbitrage overnight and fails to recharge in time: DR eligibility fails. AI must warn and modify dispatch algorithm.\n\n10.7 Multi-Day DR Scenarios If consecutive DR events occur, SOC behavior must be modeled across days.\n\n10.8 Real-Time DR (Fast DR) Fast DR programs require 1–5 minute ramp times. Most C&I batteries cannot achieve this without inverter surge. AI must mark such programs as “Not Eligible” unless battery supports high-speed discharge.\n\n10.9 Frequency Response Constraints Frequency response requires sub-second ramp: Ramp < 0.5 seconds Inverter must be grid-forming or grid-following with fast tracking AI must treat frequency response as “Not Eligible” for normal BESS.\n\n10.10 DR Dispatch pseudocode If DR_event == true: Discharge = min(P_commit, inverter limit, P_available_from_SOC) SOC decreases accordingly If SOC < required → DR violation → invalidate scenario\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 11 — BMS FIRMWARE CONSTRAINTS\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.1 Purpose of BMS The BMS enforces safety, longevity, thermal protection, and charge control. Even if the AI calculates theoretically possible behaviors, the BMS may override them.\n\n11.2 BMS-Imposed Power Caps BMS may limit power dynamically based on: Temperature SOC Cell imbalance Cycle count Fault flags\n\nAI must recheck battery power at each interval.\n\n11.3 Temperature-Based BMS Derating If T > T_thresh: Battery power is reduced If T > T_shutdown: Battery shuts down\n\nTypical shutdown at 60–70°C cell temp.\n\n11.4 SOC Enforcement BMS stops charging when SOC >= SOC_max BMS stops discharging when SOC <= SOC_min\n\nAI must reflect this behavior.\n\n11.5 Fault Mode Behavior On fault: BMS opens contactor Battery stops discharging and charging AI must set battery power = 0\n\n11.6 Communication Failures If communication with EMS is lost: Battery enters safe mode AI must handle fallback behaviors (e.g., idle state)\n\n11.7 Balancing Behavior When cells drift, balancing reduces charge rate or usable SOC. AI must reduce charge acceptance near SOC ceiling.\n\n11.8 Protection Algorithms Overvoltage Undervoltage Overcurrent Over-temperature Under-temperature Isolation fault BMS shuts off battery.\n\nAI must adopt conservative constraints reflecting BMS intervention.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 12 — INVERTER CONTROL & PCS FIRMWARE\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.1 PCS Control Loops The power conversion system uses: Current control loop Voltage control loop Phase-locked loop Grid synchronization\n\nAI must understand that inverter output is controlled, not free-running.\n\n12.2 Inverter Ramp Rate Inverters typically allow ramp rates: dP/dt <= MaxRampRate\n\nExample: 10 kW per second AI must respect ramp rate limits.\n\n12.3 Grid Support Functions Inverters may be required to: Provide reactive power support Ride through voltage dips Follow volt-var curves Limit power factor\n\nAI must not violate grid-code constraints.\n\n12.4 Inverter derating at high temperature PCS temperature limits reduce AC power. AI must derate output accordingly.\n\n12.5 Voltage and Frequency Ride-Through AI must enforce: Under-voltage lockout Over-voltage lockout Over-frequency lockout Under-frequency lockout\n\nIn these conditions, battery disconnects.\n\n12.6 PCS Startup and Shutdown Times PCS often requires 30–180 seconds to start or stop. AI cannot assume instantaneous availability.\n\nBATTERY TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS MANUAL\n\nPART 3 — SAFETY, THERMAL RUNAWAY, UL9540A, NFPA 855\n\nRAW STRUCTURED TEXT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 13 — THERMAL RUNAWAY MODELING AND PREVENTION\n\n13.1 Purpose of Thermal Runaway Modeling Thermal runaway represents the most severe catastrophic failure mode in lithium-ion battery systems. Any engineering, AI, or dispatch model must incorporate thermal constraints to prevent simulation of conditions that could theoretically trigger runaway events. Thermal runaway cannot be “controlled” once initiated; prevention is the only acceptable strategy. The AI must therefore implement strict boundaries to ensure all modeled operating conditions remain safely within allowable thermal limits.\n\n13.2 Root Causes of Thermal Runaway Thermal runaway may originate from: Internal short circuits Mechanical penetration Manufacturing defect Lithium plating followed by dendrite formation Overtemperature Overvoltage Overcurrent External fire exposure Poor ventilation causing trapped heat Failure of cooling systems Localized thermal gradients\n\nAI must model and avoid all operational conditions that increase thermal runaway probability.\n\n13.3 Exothermic Reaction Model Thermal runaway begins when the rate of heat generated internally exceeds the rate at which the cooling system can remove heat.\n\nDefine: Q_gen = heat generated internally Q_dis = heat dissipated (cooling, convection, radiation) Thermal runaway condition: Q_gen > Q_dis\n\nInternal heat generation approximated by: Q_gen = I^2 × R_internal + ExothermicChemicalHeat\n\nAt high temperatures, chemical heat generation increases exponentially.\n\nAI must approximate: If Temperature > Threshold_1 (typically 80°C) → elevated risk If Temperature > Threshold_2 (typically 120°C) → runaway inevitable\n\n13.4 Thermal Mass and Heat Capacity Battery pack thermal characteristics defined by: ΔT = Q_gen / (m × Cp) Where: m = mass of battery Cp = specific heat capacity\n\nAI must model rapid temperature rise at high current or low mass systems.\n\n13.5 Hot Spot Formation Cells do not heat uniformly. Localized hot spots cause early runaway. AI modeling must be conservative and assume uniform temperature only for safety modeling. If inadequate cooling or high C-rate is involved → derate power.\n\n13.6 Cooling System Failure Logic If cooling fails: Q_dis = 0 Thus, runaway threshold is reached quicker.\n\nAI must disable high-discharge or high-charge-rate models when cooling assumptions are unknown.\n\n13.7 Early Detection Indicators AI should model that early warning indicators include: Cell voltage imbalance Higher-than-expected internal resistance Slow charge acceptance Sudden temperature rise (>3°C per minute)\n\nIf any indicator predicted → AI must flag “Unsafe Operating Envelope”.\n\n13.8 AI Guardrails for Thermal Runaway AI must not: Model C-rate > manufacturer limit Allow operation above 55°C sustained temperature Allow charging below 0°C Allow discharging beyond thermal envelope Predict peak output for periods longer than thermal capacity Ignore cooling limitations Assume unlimited thermal dissipation\n\nAny breach must produce a critical error.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 14 — UL9540A ENGINEERING ENVELOPE\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.1 Purpose of UL9540A UL9540A is a destructive fire testing methodology that determines propagation risk in a battery energy storage system (BESS).

Introduction: The Stochastic Control Challenge of Demand Charge Management\n\n\n\nThe modern electrical grid is undergoing a fundamental transformation characterized by the rapid integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) and the electrification of large-scale loads such as electric vehicle fleets and industrial heat pumps. In this dynamic landscape, the optimization of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) has transcended simple arbitrage strategies—buying low and selling high—to encompass complex ancillary services and, most critically, peak shaving.1 Peak shaving, the reduction of grid demand during intervals of maximum consumption, is driven economically by demand charges: tariffs where utility customers are billed not just for the volume of energy consumed (kWh) but for the maximum rate of consumption (kW) recorded over a billing period, typically a month.3\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, demand charge management represents a uniquely challenging stochastic control problem. Unlike energy arbitrage, which relies on additive cost functions over time, the demand charge introduces a non-additive, non-convex $\\max(\\cdot)$ operator over the entire decision horizon. The cost function $J$ is generally formulated as:\n\n$$ J = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} c_t^{energy} P_t^{grid} \\Delta t + c^{demand} \\max_{t \\in {1, \\dots, T}} (P_t^{grid}) $$\n\nThis structure implies that a single suboptimal decision at any timestep $t$—specifically, a failure to discharge the battery during the true peak—can irrevocably determine the cost for the entire month, rendering all other optimal decisions moot.3 Furthermore, this operator is non-differentiable in the classical sense, complicating the application of gradient-based optimization methods common in modern machine learning.\n\nCompounding this structural difficulty is the stochastic nature of the inputs. The load $P_t^{load}$ is a non-stationary time series subject to human behavior, industrial schedules, and weather conditions. Traditional \"Predict-then-Optimize\" frameworks, which first forecast the load using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and then optimize the battery schedule, fail to capture the asymmetric risk profile of this problem.7 Under-predicting a peak is catastrophically expensive, while over-predicting incurs only minor efficiency losses. Therefore, a robust model requires a paradigm shift towards advanced mathematical architectures that can handle:\n\nHigh-Dimensional Probabilistic Forecasting: Moving beyond point estimates to model full conditional distributions and long-range dependencies, utilizing architectures like the Informer with $O(L \\log L)$ complexity.9\n\nEnd-to-End Differentiable Optimization: Embedding the optimization problem itself as a layer within the neural network (e.g., CvxPyLayers), allowing gradients to backpropagate through the KKT conditions of the physical constraints.10\n\nDistributional and Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL): Replacing expected-value maximization with the optimization of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) via Distributional RL methods like Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN), and addressing sparse rewards through rigorous Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS).11\n\nThis report provides an exhaustive mathematical analysis of these architectures, detailing the derivations, theoretical justifications, and integrative mechanisms required to build a state-of-the-art peak shaving model.\n\n\n\n2. Physics and Economics of the BESS Environment\n\n\n\nTo construct a high-fidelity machine learning model, one must first rigorously define the physical and economic environment governing the BESS. The mathematical formulation of the state transitions and cost surfaces defines the manifold on which the learning algorithms must operate.\n\n\n\n2.1 Battery State Dynamics and Efficiency Models\n\n\n\nThe evolution of the battery's energy state, $E_t$, is a discrete-time dynamical system. While simplified models assume constant efficiency, a high-performance model must account for the non-linear losses associated with electrochemical conversion.\n\nLet $P_t^{batt}$ be the power flow at the battery terminals at time $t$, where $P_t^{batt} > 0$ denotes discharging (injecting power to the building/grid) and $P_t^{batt} < 0$ denotes charging. The net power drawn from the grid, $P_t^{grid}$, is given by the power balance equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$P_t^{grid} = P_t^{load} - P_t^{batt}$$\n\n\n\nIdeally, we constrain $P_t^{grid} \\le P_{limit}$, but in the demand charge context, $P_{limit}$ is a decision variable (the target peak) rather than a hard physical constraint.3\n\nThe state of charge (SoC) update equation incorporates charging efficiency $\\eta_{ch} \\in (0, 1]$ and discharging efficiency $\\eta_{dis} \\in (0, 1]$:\n\n$$ E_{t+1} = E_t - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\eta_{dis}} \\cdot [P_t^{batt}]^+ - \\eta_{ch} \\cdot [P_t^{batt}]^- \\right) \\Delta t $$\n\nwhere $[x]^+ = \\max(0, x)$ and $[x]^- = \\max(0, -x)$.\n\nThis piecewise linear formulation introduces a non-smoothness at $P_t^{batt} = 0$. In convex optimization contexts, this is typically handled by splitting $P_t^{batt}$ into two non-negative variables, $P_t^{dis}$ and $P_t^{ch}$, such that $P_t^{batt} = P_t^{dis} - P_t^{ch}$. To prevent simultaneous charging and discharging (which is physically impossible but mathematically feasible in relaxed linear programs), one often introduces binary variables or relies on the cost structure to discourage waste. However, in a differentiable layer context, avoiding binary variables is crucial to maintain gradient flow.14 The objective function naturally penalizes simultaneous flows because $\\eta_{ch} < 1$ and $\\eta_{dis} < 1$ imply that any circular flow dissipates energy, increasing the net cost.\n\nPhysical constraints define the feasible region $\\mathcal{C}$:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$E_{min} \\le E_t \\le E_{max} \\quad \\forall t$$\n\n\n\n$$0 \\le P_t^{ch} \\le P_{max}^{ch}$$\n\n\n\n$$0 \\le P_t^{dis} \\le P_{max}^{dis}$$\n\n\n\n2.2 The Non-Convexity of Demand Tariffs\n\n\n\nThe economic landscape is defined by the tariff structure. Industrial tariffs typically include:\n\nTime-of-Use (ToU) Energy Charges: $c_t^{energy}$ varies by hour (e.g., on-peak, off-peak, super-off-peak).\n\nDemand Charges: A high cost $c^{demand}$ applied to the maximum grid power drawn over the billing cycle $T$.\n\nThe demand charge term, $C_{DC} = c^{demand} \\max_{t \\in} P_t^{grid}$, creates a global dependency. The gradient of this term with respect to power at time $t$, $\\frac{\\partial C_{DC}}{\\partial P_t^{grid}}$, is zero for all $t$ except the set of timesteps where the maximum is achieved.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C_{DC}}{\\partial P_t^{grid}} = \\begin{cases} c^{demand} & \\text{if } P_t^{grid} = \\max_{\\tau} P_\\tau^{grid} \\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n\nThis \"sparse gradient\" problem makes direct gradient descent training difficult. If the model successfully lowers the current peak at $t_{peak}$, the gradient instantly shifts to a new $t'_{peak}$. This phenomenon, known as \"peak hopping,\" requires the optimization landscape to consider the joint distribution of all potential peaks, not just the current maximum.3\n\nFurthermore, the billing period $T$ (one month) is significantly longer than the typical prediction horizon of standard load forecasters (24-48 hours). This necessitates a hierarchical or \"rolling horizon\" approach where short-term decisions are guided by long-term value functions or cost-to-go approximations derived from RL or advanced forecasting.16\n\n\n\n3. Advanced Probabilistic Forecasting: The Informer Architecture\n\n\n\nTo mitigate the risk of peak exceedance, the control model requires accurate probabilistic forecasts of future loads. Standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTMs struggle with the long sequences required to capture weekly or monthly periodicities ($L \\approx 720$ to $2000$ hourly steps). The Transformer architecture, while powerful in capturing long-range dependencies via self-attention, suffers from $O(L^2)$ computational and memory complexity. For peak shaving, where we must analyze weeks of history to predict extreme events, this quadratic scaling is prohibitive.\n\nThe Informer architecture 9 solves this via the ProbSparse Self-Attention mechanism, achieving $O(L \\log L)$ complexity. We will now rigorously derive the mathematics behind this efficiency and its relevance to building the peak shaving model.\n\n\n\n3.1 Mathematical Derivation of ProbSparse Attention\n\n\n\nThe standard self-attention mechanism computes a score between a query $Q$, key $K$, and value $V$:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)V$$\n\n\n\nLet $q_i$ be the $i$-th row of $Q$, $k_j$ the $j$-th row of $K$, and $v_j$ the $j$-th row of $V$. The attention weight $A(q_i, K)$ defines a probability distribution $p(k_j | q_i)$ over the keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$p(k_j | q_i) = \\frac{\\exp(q_i k_j^T / \\sqrt{d})}{\\sum_{l} \\exp(q_i k_l^T / \\sqrt{d})}$$\n\nThe Sparsity Hypothesis:\n\nEmpirical observation in time-series data suggests that the distribution of attention scores is long-tailed. For many queries, the dot products $q_i k_j^T$ result in a near-uniform probability distribution over keys. A uniform attention distribution, $q(k_j | q_i) = 1/L_K$, essentially computes a mean of the value vectors $V$, providing no specific local information. These are termed \"lazy\" queries. Conversely, \"active\" queries have a sharp, peaked distribution, focusing heavily on specific keys (e.g., historical peak events similar to the current context).19\n\nTo optimize efficiency, we should only compute the expensive dot products for \"active\" queries. We identify these by measuring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between the query's attention distribution $p$ and the uniform distribution $q$:\n\n$$ KL(q_i |\n\n| U) = \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} p(k_j | q_i) \\ln \\frac{p(k_j | q_i)}{1/L_K} $$\n\n$$ KL(q_i |\n\n| U) = \\ln L_K + \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} p(k_j | q_i) \\ln p(k_j | q_i) $$\n\nSince explicitly computing $p(k_j | q_i)$ requires the $O(L)$ summation we wish to avoid, the Informer uses an approximation based on the Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) inequality. The sparsity measurement $M(q_i, K)$ is defined as:\n\n$$ M(q_i, K) = \\ln \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{L_K} \\sum_{j=1}^{L_K} \\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}} $$\n\nThis measurement represents the difference between the LSE of the unnormalized attention scores and their arithmetic mean.21 If this difference is large, the distribution is peaked (active). If small, it is uniform (lazy).\n\nSampling Approximation:\n\nTo avoid iterating over all $j$, the Informer randomly samples a subset of keys $U_{sample}$ of size $c \\cdot \\ln L_K$. The measurement is approximated as:\n\n$$ \\bar{M}(q_i, K) = \\max_{k_j \\in U_{sample}} \\left(\\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{L_K} \\sum_{k_j \\in U_{sample}} \\left(\\frac{q_i k_j^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) $$\n\nUsing this metric, we select the top-$u$ queries (where $u = c \\cdot \\ln L_Q$). We compute the full cross-attention only for these $u$ queries. For the remaining $L_Q - u$ queries, we simply assign the mean of the value vectors $V$. This reduces the complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L \\log L)$, allowing the model to process significantly longer history windows (e.g., 2 weeks at 15-minute resolution = 1344 points) to identify recurring peak patterns.9\n\n\n\n3.2 Self-Attention Distilling and Generative Decoding\n\n\n\nFor peak shaving, we need to predict a sequence of future loads (e.g., the next 24 hours). The Informer employs a Generative Style Decoder to output the entire sequence in a single forward pass, unlike the step-by-step autoregressive decoding of standard Transformers which accumulates error.\n\nFurthermore, to handle the hierarchy of temporal features (from weekly trends down to hourly spikes), the encoder uses Self-Attention Distilling. Between attention blocks, a convolutional layer with max-pooling reduces the sequence length:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$X_{j+1} = \\text{MaxPool}(\\text{ELU}(\\text{Conv1d}(X_j)))$$\n\n\n\nThis operation halves the dimension $L$ at each layer, constructing a pyramid of features. Mathematically, this enforces that higher layers in the network attend to coarser-grained, dominant features (like daily baselines), while lower layers attend to fine-grained details (like instantaneous power spikes). This multi-scale representation is critical for separating the \"base load\" from the \"peak load\" components of the demand.19\n\n\n\n3.3 Pinball Loss for Probabilistic Output\n\n\n\nStandard regression minimizes Mean Squared Error (MSE), which estimates the conditional mean $\\mathbb{E}[y|x]$. However, for risk-sensitive control, we need the conditional quantiles (e.g., the 90th percentile $q_{0.9}$). We employ the Pinball Loss (or Quantile Loss).24\n\nFor a quantile $\\tau \\in (0, 1)$, the loss is:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$L_\\tau(y, \\hat{y}) = \\max(\\tau(y - \\hat{y}), (\\tau - 1)(y - \\hat{y}))$$\n\nGradient Analysis:\n\nThe gradient of the Pinball loss with respect to the prediction $\\hat{y}$ is:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_\\tau}{\\partial \\hat{y}} = \\begin{cases} -\\tau & \\text{if } y > \\hat{y} \\ 1 - \\tau & \\text{if } y \\le \\hat{y} \\end{cases} $$\n\nThis gradient is constant but asymmetric. If $\\tau = 0.95$ (modeling the upper tail of demand), under-prediction ($y > \\hat{y}$) generates a gradient of magnitude $0.95$, while over-prediction generates a gradient of $0.05$. This forces the neural network to prioritize upper-bound accuracy heavily. By training on a composite loss $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} L_\\tau$, where $\\mathcal{T} = \\{0.1, 0.5, 0.9\\}$, the Informer outputs a full probabilistic cone of future demand, enabling the optimization layer to make risk-aware decisions.26\n\n\n\n4. End-to-End Differentiable Optimization Layers\n\n\n\nThe classical \"Predict-then-Optimize\" pipeline decouples the forecasting model from the decision model. The forecaster minimizes Pinball loss, and the optimizer minimizes cost given the forecast. This is suboptimal because the \"cost of error\" is not uniform; an error in forecasting a non-peak hour has zero economic impact, while an error at a peak hour has massive impact.\n\nTo align these objectives, we utilize Differentiable Convex Optimization Layers (such as CvxPyLayers or OptNet). This allows us to embed the battery dispatch optimization inside the neural network, permitting backpropagation from the final electricity bill directly to the forecasting weights.10\n\n\n\n4.1 Canonicalization and the KKT Conditions\n\n\n\nWe formulate the daily battery dispatch as a convex optimization problem parameterized by the forecast $\\hat{y}$ (output of the Informer). Let $z$ be the decision variables (battery power $P^{batt}$, state of energy $E$).\n\n\n\n$$\\min_z f(z; \\theta) \\quad \\text{s.t. } Gz \\le h, Az = b$$\n\nHere, $\\theta$ represents the parameters provided by the neural network (e.g., the forecasted load vector $\\hat{P}^{load}$). The layer outputs the optimal schedule $z^*(\\theta)$.\n\nTo compute the gradient $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta}$ (where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the final cost), we need the Jacobian $\\frac{\\partial z^*}{\\partial \\theta}$. We derive this by differentiating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions.\n\nThe KKT conditions for the problem are:\n\nPrimal Feasibility: $Az^* - b = 0, \\quad Gz^* - h \\le 0$\n\nDual Feasibility: $\\lambda^* \\ge 0$\n\nStationarity: $\\nabla_z f(z^*) + A^T \\nu^* + G^T \\lambda^* = 0$\n\nComplementary Slackness: $\\text{diag}(\\lambda^*) (Gz^* - h) = 0$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{R}(z, \\lambda, \\nu, \\theta) = 0$ be the system of equations representing these conditions. By the Implicit Function Theorem, the total differential is zero:\n\n$$ \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{R} + \\nabla_{(z, \\lambda, \\nu)} \\mathcal{R} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial (z, \\lambda, \\nu)}{\\partial \\theta} = 0 $$\n\nThus, the Jacobian of the solution is:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (z^, \\lambda^, \\nu^*)}{\\partial \\theta} = - \\left( \\nabla_{(z, \\lambda, \\nu)} \\mathcal{R} \\right)^{-1} \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{R} $$\n\nThe matrix $\\nabla_{(z, \\lambda, \\nu)} \\mathcal{R}$ is the KKT matrix. For a quadratic program (QP), this matrix takes the form:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$K = \\begin{bmatrix} Q & G^T & A^T \\\\ D(\\lambda^*)G & D(Gz^* - h) & 0 \\\\ A & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n\n\nwhere $D(\\cdot)$ denotes a diagonal matrix.\n\n\n\n4.2 Handling Active Constraints and Matrix Singularity\n\n\n\nIn battery optimization, constraints such as $E_{min} \\le E_t \\le E_{max}$ are frequently active (the battery is full or empty). The complementary slackness condition introduces non-differentiability when a constraint switches from active to inactive. CvxPyLayers handles this by smoothing the KKT conditions or by formulating the backward pass using the homogeneous self-dual embedding.10\n\nA critical implementation detail is ensuring the KKT matrix $K$ is non-singular. In cases where the problem is degenerate (e.g., multiple optimal solutions), $K$ is not invertible. To mitigate this, we add a small regularization term $\\epsilon \\|z\\|_2^2$ to the objective function, making the problem strictly convex and the KKT matrix non-singular. This ensures stable gradient flow even when the battery is idle.29\n\n\n\n4.3 Integrating with the Peak Shaving Loss\n\n\n\nWith the Jacobian $\\frac{\\partial z^*}{\\partial \\hat{y}}$ available, we define the loss function as the actual cost of the schedule $z^*$ against the true load $y_{true}$:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\text{Cost}(z^*(\\hat{y}(\\theta)), y_{true})$$\n\n\n\n$$ \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\partial \\text{Cost}}{\\partial z^} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^}{\\partial \\hat{y}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial \\theta} $$\n\nThis gradient chain has a profound physical interpretation. The term $\\frac{\\partial z^*}{\\partial \\hat{y}}$ quantifies the sensitivity of the battery schedule to the forecast.\n\nIf the battery is constrained (e.g., fully charged) and cannot react to a change in forecast, the sensitivity is zero, and the gradient vanishes.\n\nIf the battery is actively shaving a peak, the sensitivity is high.\n\nCritically, this mechanism automatically weights the forecasting loss. Errors in the forecast that do not change the optimal dispatch (e.g., errors during off-peak times where the battery is idle) receive zero weight. Errors during peak times that alter the dispatch receive high weight. This effectively learns a \"task-based loss function\" without manual engineering.7\n\n\n\n5. Distributional Reinforcement Learning\n\n\n\nWhile differentiable optimization is powerful for planning over short, deterministic horizons, it struggles with the inherent stochasticity of the month-long demand charge problem. The \"true\" peak might occur 20 days from now, beyond the horizon of a daily optimizer. Reinforcement Learning (RL) maps states to actions $(s \\to a)$ to maximize long-term cumulative reward, making it suitable for this infinite-horizon control.\n\nHowever, standard RL (like DQN or PPO) estimates the expected return $Q(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}$. For peak shaving, the expected return is insufficient because the cost is driven by tail risks (rare, extreme load events). A policy that maximizes expected return might be risky, accepting a 5% chance of a massive peak to save small amounts of energy daily. We need a risk-averse policy, which requires Distributional RL.11\n\n\n\n5.1 The Distributional Bellman Operator\n\n\n\nIn Distributional RL, we model the full distribution of returns $Z(s,a)$ rather than just its mean. The scalar Bellman equation is replaced by a distributional one:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$Z(s,a) \\overset{D}{=} R(s,a) + \\gamma Z(s', a')$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\overset{D}{=}$ denotes equality in distribution. $Z$ is a random variable.\n\nTo implement this, we use Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN).33 We approximate the distribution $Z(s,a)$ using a discrete set of $N$ quantiles, supported at cumulative probabilities $\\tau_i = \\frac{i - 0.5}{N}$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$. The network outputs a vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(s,a) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$, where $\\theta_i$ estimates the value of the $\\tau_i$-th quantile.\n\n\n\n5.2 Wasserstein Distance and Quantile Loss\n\n\n\nUnlike Categorical DQN (C51) which minimizes KL divergence between categorical distributions, QR-DQN minimizes the 1-Wasserstein distance between the predicted distribution and the target distribution. The Wasserstein metric is crucial here because it is a true metric on probability distributions and provides meaningful gradients even when the supports of the distributions are disjoint (which is common in deterministic reward environments like battery control).35\n\nThe loss function for QR-DQN is the Huber Quantile Loss averaged over all pairs of predicted quantiles $\\theta_i$ and target quantiles $\\theta_j'$:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}{QR} = \\sum{i=1}^N \\mathbb{E}{s,a,r,s'} \\left[ \\sum{j=1}^N \\rho_{\\tau_i}^\\kappa (r + \\gamma \\theta_j(s', a^*) - \\theta_i(s,a)) \\right]\n\n$$where $\\rho_{\\tau}^\\kappa(u)$ is the Huber loss variants for quantiles:$$\n\n\\rho_{\\tau}^\\kappa(u) = | \\tau - \\mathbb{I}{{u < 0}} | \\frac{\\mathcal{L}\\kappa(u)}{\\kappa} $$\n\nand $\\mathcal{L}_\\kappa$ is the standard Huber loss.\n\n\n\n5.3 Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN)\n\n\n\nAn advancement over QR-DQN is Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN). Instead of fixed quantiles $\\tau_i$, IQN takes $\\tau$ as an input to the network (sampled from a base distribution, e.g., $U$) and outputs the corresponding quantile value $Z_\\tau(s,a)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n$$Z_\\tau(s,a) \\approx f(\\psi(s), \\phi(\\tau))$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\phi(\\tau)$ is an embedding of the probability $\\tau$. This allows the network to query any part of the return distribution distribution, providing infinite resolution. For peak shaving, this is valuable as it allows us to focus arbitrarily closely on the extreme tails ($\\tau \\to 1$) where the demand charge risks lie.12\n\n\n\n6. Risk-Sensitive Control via CVaR Optimization\n\n\n\nHaving access to the return distribution $Z(s,a)$ enables us to construct policies that explicitly minimize tail risk. The most appropriate risk measure for peak shaving is Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) (also known as Expected Shortfall).\n\n\n\n6.1 CVaR Formulation\n\n\n\nFor a random cost variable $C$ (or negative return $-Z$) and confidence level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ (e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$), the Value at Risk ($VaR_\\alpha$) is:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$VaR_\\alpha(C) = \\inf \\{ c : P(C \\le c) \\ge \\alpha \\}$$\n\n\n\nThe $CVaR_\\alpha$ is the expected cost given that the cost exceeds the VaR:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$CVaR_\\alpha(C) = \\mathbb{E}$$\n\nIn the context of Distributional RL, where $Z$ represents returns (higher is better), we are interested in the lower tail (worst outcomes). The lower-tail CVaR at level $\\alpha$ is:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$CVaR_\\alpha(Z) = \\mathbb{E}[Z | Z \\le F_Z^{-1}(\\alpha)]$$\n\n\n\n6.2 Risk-Sensitive Policy Update\n\n\n\nWith QR-DQN, we have explicit estimates of the quantiles $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_N$. Since $\\tau_i$ are uniformly spaced, the $\\alpha$-CVaR can be approximated by averaging the lowest $k = \\lfloor \\alpha N \\rfloor$ quantiles.34\n\nThe risk-sensitive policy $\\pi_{CVaR}$ selects actions to maximize this lower-tail average, effectively ignoring the optimistic upper tail:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$a^*_{CVaR} = \\text{argmax}_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\alpha N \\rfloor} \\theta_i(s,a)$$\n\nThis mathematical modification transforms the agent. A standard agent ($\\alpha=1$) maximizes the mean. A risk-averse agent ($\\alpha=0.1$) maximizes the worst-case 10% of outcomes.\n\nInsight: In peak shaving, this means the agent will discharge the battery even if the probability of a peak is only 10%. It hedges against the \"worst-case scenario\" that the load might spike, ensuring the demand charge is minimized even in unlikely weather events. This robustness is mathematically guaranteed by the CVaR objective.37\n\n\n\n6.3 Policy Gradient Theorem for CVaR\n\n\n\nFor continuous control (where action space is continuous power $P^{batt}$), we cannot simply iterate over discrete actions. We must use policy gradient methods. The gradient of the CVaR objective requires careful derivation.\n\nUsing the dual representation of CVaR:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$CVaR_\\alpha(Z) = \\max_{\\nu} \\left( \\nu - \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\mathbb{E}[( \\nu - Z )^+] \\right)$$\n\nTamar et al. 39 derived the gradient of CVaR with respect to policy parameters $\\theta$:\n\n\n\n$$\\nabla_\\theta J_{CVaR}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\mathbb{E}_{s,a \\sim \\pi_\\theta} \\left$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\nu^*$ is the optimal VaR value.\n\nInterpretation: The indicator function $\\mathbb{I}_{\\{R \\le \\nu^*\\}}$ acts as a filter. The gradient is computed only using trajectories that resulted in returns worse than the VaR threshold. This focuses the learning entirely on the \"failure cases\" (months where peaks were not successfully shaved), ensuring the neural network updates its weights to specifically prevent these catastrophic outliers. This is mathematically distinct from standard Policy Gradient (REINFORCE), which averages over all trajectories.41\n\n\n\n7. Addressing Sparse Rewards: Potential-Based Reward Shaping\n\n\n\nA fundamental difficulty in RL for demand charges is the reward sparsity. The agent receives feedback on the demand charge only at the end of the month (step $T \\approx 720$). For the preceding 719 steps, the demand charge reward is zero. This \"temporal credit assignment\" problem makes convergence usually slow or impossible.42\n\nTo solve this, we employ Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS). We construct a shaping function $F(s,s')$ that provides immediate feedback while mathematically guaranteeing that the optimal policy is unchanged.\n\n\n\n7.1 PBRS Theorem and Policy Invariance\n\n\n\nAccording to Ng et al. 43, if the shaping reward is of the form:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$F(s, s') = \\gamma \\Phi(s') - \\Phi(s)$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\Phi: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is any real-valued function of state, then the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ for the shaped MDP is identical to the optimal policy for the original MDP. This is a rigorous sufficiency condition.\n\n\n\n7.2 Deriving the Demand Charge Potential\n\n\n\nWe need a potential function $\\Phi(s)$ that captures the \"loom\" of the demand charge. Let the state $s_t$ include the variable $p_t^{max}$, representing the maximum peak recorded so far in the current billing cycle:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$p_t^{max} = \\max(P_1^{grid}, \\dots, P_t^{grid})$$\n\nThe final demand charge cost is $C_{DC} = \\mu_d \\cdot p_T^{max}$. This suggests the potential function should be related to the negative of the current accumulated peak cost:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\\Phi(s_t) = - \\mu_d \\cdot p_t^{max}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the PBRS equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$F(s_t, s_{t+1}) = \\gamma (-\\mu_d p_{t+1}^{max}) - (-\\mu_d p_t^{max})$$\n\n\n\n$$F(s_t, s_{t+1}) = \\mu_d (p_t^{max} - \\gamma p_{t+1}^{max})$$\n\nAssuming $\\gamma \\approx 1$ for the shaping intuition:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$F(s_t, s_{t+1}) \\approx -\\mu_d (p_{t+1}^{max} - p_t^{max})$$\n\nMathematical Implication:\n\nIf $P_{t+1}^{grid} \\le p_t^{max}$, then $p_{t+1}^{max} = p_t^{max}$, and $F \\approx 0$.\n\nIf $P_{t+1}^{grid} > p_t^{max}$, then $p_{t+1}^{max} > p_t^{max}$, and $F < 0$. Specifically, $F = -\\mu_d (P_{t+1}^{grid} - p_t^{max})$.\n\nThis transformation converts the sparse monthly penalty into a dense, immediate penalty. Every time the agent allows the grid power to exceed the current month's historical maximum, it receives an instantaneous penalty proportional to the increment of the new peak. This provides a dense gradient signal at every step where a new peak is established, allowing the value function to converge rapidly while mathematically preserving the global optimality of the monthly minimization objective.6\n\n\n\n8. Integrated Architecture: The End-to-End Relearning Framework\n\n\n\nTo synthesize these components into a unified model, we propose a Bi-Level End-to-End Relearning Framework.46\n\n\n\n8.1 Architecture Diagram\n\n\n\nOuter Loop (Policy Learning): A Risk-Sensitive Distributional RL agent (QR-DQN) determines the high-level strategy (e.g., target SoC or marginal price threshold) to manage long-term risk and monthly demand charges.\n\nInner Loop (Differentiable Control): A CvxPyLayer solves the short-term (24h) constrained optimization problem given the RL agent's strategic parameters and the Informer's probabilistic forecasts.\n\nForecaster: The Informer network provides quantile forecasts $\\hat{Y} = [\\hat{y}_{0.1}, \\hat{y}_{0.5}, \\hat{y}_{0.9}]$.\n\nData Flow:\n\n$$ \\text{State } s_t \\xrightarrow{Informer} \\hat{Y}_t \\xrightarrow{QR-DQN} \\text{Strategy } \\theta_t \\xrightarrow{CvxPyLayer} \\text{Action } P_t^{batt} $$\n\n\n\n8.2 Joint Optimization Objective\n\n\n\nThe entire pipeline is differentiable. We can define a joint loss function:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}{total} = \\lambda_1 \\mathcal{L}{Pinball}(\\hat{Y}, Y_{true}) + \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{L}{CVaR}(P^{batt}, C{DC}) + \\lambda_3 \\mathcal{L}_{Reg} $$\n\nGradients backpropagate from the CVaR cost through the CvxPyLayer (via KKT implicit differentiation) to the QR-DQN and Informer weights simultaneously. This ensures that the forecaster learns features relevant to control (features that minimize CVaR) rather than just minimizing RMSE.46\n\n\n\n8.3 Handling Non-Stationarity\n\n\n\nGrid environments are non-stationary (NS-MDP). Seasonality and degrading battery health change the transition dynamics $P(s'|s,a)$. The framework includes a Relearning Trigger. We monitor the distribution of prediction errors. If the KL divergence between the recent error distribution and the training error distribution exceeds a threshold $\\delta$, the model triggers an online update, fine-tuning the weights on the most recent window of experience. This ensures the model adapts to seasonal shifts or battery aging effects.46\n\n\n\n9. Conclusion\n\n\n\nThe optimization of energy storage for peak shaving is a problem that defies simple heuristic or standard supervised learning solutions due to the specific mathematical properties of the demand charge: global temporal dependency, non-convexity of the max operator, and the extreme asymmetry of risk.\n\nTo build a robust model, one must implement a stack of advanced mathematical architectures:\n\nForecasting: Informer with ProbSparse Attention ($O(L \\log L)$) and Pinball Loss to capture the conditional distribution of long-sequence load data.\n\nOptimization: Differentiable Convex Layers (CvxPyLayers) to allow end-to-end gradient flow through the physical constraints of the battery.\n\nControl: Distributional RL (QR-DQN) to model the full return distribution and optimize CVaR, ensuring robustness against tail risks.\n\nReward Shaping: Potential-Based Reward Shaping with the potential $\\Phi(s) = -\\mu p_{max}$ to rigorously solve the sparse reward problem while maintaining policy invariance.\n\nThis integrated approach moves beyond \"black-box\" AI, leveraging domain-specific mathematical structures to solve the unique challenges of the stochastic energy grid.\n\n\n\n10.

The specific operational failure identified—an AI model that discharges continuously (\"shaves all day\") rather than targeting specific high-value intervals—indicates a misalignment between the control algorithm’s objective function and the stochastic, scarcity-driven nature of peak demand management. In the domain of commercial and industrial (C&I) energy management, energy (kWh) is a finite resource that must be surgically deployed to reduce power capacity (kW). A strategy that flattens \"broad hills\" of load rather than \"needle peaks\" dissipates stored energy on intervals that carry zero marginal economic value, rendering the system incapable of mitigating the true monthly maximum demand.\n\nThis report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the data architectures, mathematical formulations, and control strategies required to rectify this failure. It moves beyond simple heuristic thresholding to explore rigorous optimization frameworks—specifically Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for deterministic planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for stochastic control. By integrating specific input datasets (electricity rates, battery physics, interval load data), we define a \"Peak-Aware\" state space that enables the AI to quantify the opportunity cost of every discharged kilowatt-hour. The analysis demonstrates that effective peak shaving requires a system that learns to value the preservation of energy as highly as its deployment, acting only when the probability of setting a new billing peak exceeds a dynamically calculated risk threshold.\n\n\n\n1. The Physics and Economics of Peak Shaving\n\n\n\nTo engineer an AI capable of effective Demand Charge Management (DCM), one must first define the boundary conditions of the problem: the economic signals sent by the utility and the physical constraints imposed by the battery. The observed failure mode of continuous discharge suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of these boundary conditions within the current model's logic.\n\n\n\n1.1 The Economic Objective: Capacity vs. Energy\n\n\n\nThe primary error in the current application is likely the conflation of energy arbitrage with demand charge management.\n\nEnergy Arbitrage creates value by exploiting the differential in energy prices ($\\$/kWh$) over time. Since prices often follow a diurnal curve (low at night, high during the day), an arbitrage-focused algorithm will discharge continuously throughout the on-peak window.1\n\nPeak Shaving creates value by reducing the maximum instantaneous power draw ($\\$/kW$) recorded over a billing cycle. This charge is typically determined by a single 15-minute or 30-minute interval.3\n\nBecause the demand charge is determined by the single highest interval, reducing load in any other interval has zero marginal value for the capacity component of the bill. If a facility’s load profile has a \"needle peak\" of 500 kW at 2:00 PM and a \"broad hill\" of 400 kW from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, discharging at 10:00 AM reduces energy costs (arbitrage) but contributes nothing to demand reduction if the 2:00 PM peak is not also addressed. \"Shaving all day\" implies the AI is optimizing for energy volume rather than peak magnitude.\n\n\n\n1.2 The \"Needle Peak\" vs. \"Broad Hill\" Topology\n\n\n\nThe shape of the customer's load profile dictates the requisite energy-to-power ratio (E/P ratio) of the BESS and the difficulty of the control problem.\n\nNeedle Peaks: Characterized by low load factors, these peaks are sharp and short-duration. A BESS can effectively shave these with minimal energy expenditure. This is the ideal scenario for high-ROI peak shaving.4\n\nBroad Hills: Characterized by high load factors (e.g., continuous industrial processes). Shaving these requires massive energy reserves. If the AI attempts to shave a broad hill with a battery sized for needle peaks, it will hit its minimum State of Charge (SoC) long before the high-load period ends. Once the battery is empty, the load returns to the grid level, setting a peak that negates all previous shaving efforts.5\n\nThe AI must effectively perform Load Duration Curve Analysis in real-time. It must integrate the area under the curve above a candidate threshold $P_{target}$ to determine if the battery's energy capacity $E_{batt}$ is sufficient to sustain that threshold for the entire duration of the violation.\n\n\n\n$$E_{required} = \\int_{t_{start}}^{t_{end}} \\max(0, P_{load}(t) - P_{target}) \\, dt$$\n\nThe condition for feasibility is $E_{required} \\leq E_{batt} \\cdot \\eta_{discharge}$. The current AI model likely lacks this integral check, leading it to attack a target it cannot sustain.6\n\n\n\n1.3 Rate Structures as Design Constraints\n\n\n\nThe \"library of electricity rates\" mentioned in the query contains the essential constraints for the optimization problem. These must be parsed into specific feature vectors for the AI.\n\n\n\nRate Component\n\nData Structure\n\nImpact on Control Logic\n\nConsumption Charge\n\nTime-Series Vector ($/kWh)\n\nIncentivizes arbitrage. Can conflict with peak shaving if high prices don't align with peaks.\n\nDemand Charge (NCP)\n\nScalar ($/kW)\n\nThe primary driver for \"Peak-So-Far\" logic. Drives the scarcity value of energy.\n\nRatchet Clause\n\nConstraint ($P_{min}$)\n\nA billing mechanism where the billable peak is the maximum of the current month OR a percentage of the annual peak (e.g., 80% of summer max).3 This sets a hard floor; shaving below this level yields zero savings.\n\nCoincident Peak (CP)\n\nStochastic Flag\n\nA charge based on the grid's peak, not the customer's. Requires external grid forecasting features.\n\nThe \"Shaving All Day\" error often arises when the optimizer over-weights the Consumption Charge (Arbitrage) relative to the Demand Charge, or fails to model the Ratchet Clause, attempting to shave below a \"sunk cost\" floor.\n\n\n\n2. Advanced Data Engineering: Feeding the AI\n\n\n\nThe user query specifies that the system has access to \"customer interval data,\" \"batteries,\" and \"electricity rates.\" To fix the control logic, these raw inputs must be transformed into a sophisticated State Space that gives the AI situational awareness. The model cannot learn to conserve energy for a future peak if its input features do not explicitly quantify \"risk\" and \"future scarcity.\"\n\n\n\n2.1 The \"Peak-Aware\" State Space Features\n\n\n\nStandard time-series forecasting uses past load to predict future load. For peak shaving, the AI needs features that describe the relationship between the current load and the billing constraints. The following engineered features are mandatory.7\n\n\n\n2.1.1 The \"Peak-So-Far\" Vector\n\n\n\nThis is the single most critical feature for preventing unnecessary discharge.\n\nPeak_Observed_Month ($P_{max\\_observed}$): The maximum demand recorded by the meter since the start of the current billing cycle.\n\nCalculation: $P_{max\\_observed} = \\max(\\{P_{load}(\\tau) \\mid \\tau \\in [0, t]\\})$\n\nHeadroom ($P_{headroom}$): The distance between the current load and the observed peak.\n\nCalculation: $P_{headroom}(t) = P_{load}(t) - P_{max\\_observed}$\n\nSignal Value:\n\nIf $P_{headroom} > 0$: The facility is actively setting a new peak. The battery must discharge to defend the threshold.\n\nIf $P_{headroom} < 0$: The current load is below the peak. Discharge provides no demand charge savings. The AI should idle or charge, unless energy arbitrage ($/kWh) is extremely profitable.\n\nInsight: In the current failing model, this feature is likely missing or ignored, causing the agent to see \"high load\" as a trigger to discharge, even if that \"high load\" is 50 kW below the peak set yesterday.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Temporal Scarcity Features\n\n\n\nBilling_Cycle_Progress: A normalized scalar ($0 \\rightarrow 1$) indicating position in the billing month.\n\nRelevance: Early in the month, setting a new peak is low-risk (there are 29 days left to set a higher one). Late in the month, setting a new peak is catastrophic (it locks in the charge). The AI should learn to be risk-neutral early and risk-averse late.8\n\nDays_Remaining: Integer count of days left. Used to calculate the \"option value\" of stored energy.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Cyclical Time Encoding\n\n\n\nRaw timestamps (e.g., hour 0-23) introduce discontinuities. Cyclical encoding preserves temporal proximity.10\n\nHour_Sin / Hour_Cos: $\\sin(2\\pi h/24)$, $\\cos(2\\pi h/24)$.\n\nMonth_Sin / Month_Cos: Captures seasonal variations in HVAC load (cooling degree days).\n\n\n\n2.2 Battery State and Physics Features\n\n\n\nThe \"batteries with their sizing and cost\" data must be converted into dynamic state variables.\n\nSoC (State of Charge): Current energy level (normalized $0 \\rightarrow 1$).\n\nSoH (State of Health): A derating factor (e.g., 0.92) representing capacity fade. The AI must know that 100% SoC today represents fewer kWh than it did last year.11\n\nC_Rate_Limit: The maximum power the battery can inject at this specific moment. This is non-linear; as SoC drops below 10-20% or temperature drops, the BMS (Battery Management System) throttles power output. If the AI expects 100kW but gets 50kW, the peak shaving fails.\n\n\n\n2.3 Solar PV and Net Load Integration\n\n\n\nIf the customer has onsite generation, the relevant variable is Net Load.\n\n\n\n\n\n$$P_{net}(t) = P_{load}(t) - P_{PV}(t)$$\n\n\n\nThe AI must ingest Solar Irradiance Forecasts (GHI/DNI) to predict the Net Load.\n\nClear_Sky_Index: A ratio of actual irradiance to theoretical clear-sky irradiance. This helps the AI distinguish between \"nighttime\" (predictable zero) and \"cloud cover\" (stochastic drop). High intermittency requires a higher reserve buffer in the battery.12\n\n\n\n2.4 Data Preprocessing and Cleansing\n\n\n\nRaw interval data is rarely model-ready.\n\nResampling: If the meter data is 5-minute but the demand charge is 15-minute, the data must be resampled (averaged) to 15 minutes. Optimizing at 5-minute resolution for a 15-minute charge leads to \"over-shaving\" (wasting energy on short spikes that would naturally average out).14\n\nImputation: Missing intervals should be filled via linear interpolation (for short gaps) or \"same-day-last-week\" substitution (for long gaps) to prevent the AI from interpreting a data outage as a \"zero load\" opportunity to charge.\n\n\n\n3. Forecasting Modules: The Eyes of the System\n\n\n\nTo stop \"shaving all day,\" the system needs to anticipate the magnitude and timing of the day's peak relative to the rest of the month. This requires a hierarchical forecasting architecture.\n\n\n\n3.1 Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF)\n\n\n\nThis module predicts the load profile for the next $H$ hours (Rolling Horizon).\n\nArchitecture: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are the industry standard for time-series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies (e.g., the thermal inertia of a building).15\n\nTarget Variable: Net Load ($kW$) at 15-minute resolution.\n\nInput Window: Past 24-168 hours of load, temperature, and day-type.\n\nLoss Function: The model should prioritize Peak Magnitude Accuracy over general Mean Squared Error (MSE). A standard MSE loss treats an error at 3 AM (low load) the same as an error at 3 PM (peak load).\n\nCustom Loss: Weighted MSE where weights are proportional to the load magnitude: $L = \\sum w_t (y_t - \\hat{y}_t)^2$, where $w_t = 1 + \\alpha \\cdot (y_t / \\max(y))$.\n\n\n\n3.2 Peak Probability Classification (The \"Trigger\")\n\n\n\nInstead of just predicting kW, a secondary model should predict the probability that the current day will set a monthly peak.\n\nArchitecture: Random Forest or Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier.17\n\nBinary Output: Is Today A Peak Day? (Yes/No).\n\nLogic:\n\nIf $P(Peak) < Threshold$: Enter Conservation Mode. Maintain high SoC, perform only shallow arbitrage. Do not shave load.\n\nIf $P(Peak) > Threshold$: Enter Peak Shaving Mode. Pre-charge to 100% before the window.\n\nCorrection: This specific logic gate prevents the \"shave all day\" error by disabling the shaving function entirely on days identified as non-critical.19\n\n\n\n4. Mathematical Formulation: Giving the AI the \"Math\"\n\n\n\nThe user explicitly asked to \"give it the math.\" Whether implementing a deterministic solver (MILP) or training a stochastic agent (RL), the fundamental mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is identical. The core challenge is linearizing the non-continuous \"Max\" function of the demand charge.\n\n\n\n4.1 Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Formulation\n\n\n\nThis formulation defines the theoretical optimum. It should be used to generate training data for the AI (Imitation Learning) or as the core logic in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) wrapper.20\n\nObjective Function:\n\nMinimize the total cost $J$ over the horizon $T$:\n\n$$ \\min J = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( C_{energy}(t) \\cdot P_{grid}(t) \\cdot \\Delta t \\right) + C_{demand} \\cdot P_{peak} + \\sum_{t=1}^{T} C_{deg}(P_{batt}(t)) $$\n\nWhere:\n\n$P_{grid}(t)$: Power drawn from the grid at time $t$.\n\n$C_{demand}$: Demand charge rate ($\\$/kW$).\n\n$P_{peak}$: A decision variable representing the maximum billing demand for the month.\n\n$C_{deg}$: Battery degradation cost per kWh.\n\nConstraints:\n\nPeak Definition (Linearization):To minimize $P_{peak}$, we constrain it to be greater than or equal to the grid load at every time step. The solver, seeking to minimize cost, will squeeze $P_{peak}$ down until it rests on the single highest load point.13$$P_{peak} \\ge P_{grid}(t) \\quad \\forall t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$$\n\nRatchet / Peak-So-Far Constraint:This is the mathematical fix for the \"shaving all day\" error. We constrain the solution such that $P_{peak}$ cannot be lower than the peak already observed in the past.$$P_{peak} \\ge P_{max\\_observed}$$\n\nEffect: If the facility already hit 500 kW on Day 1, and today is Day 15 with a forecasted max of 450 kW, this constraint makes $P_{peak}$ a fixed constant (500 kW) in the optimization. The marginal value of reducing the 450 kW load to 400 kW becomes zero in the demand charge term. The solver will effectively \"turn off\" peak shaving (unless energy arbitrage justifies it), preventing battery waste.8\n\nPower Balance:$$P_{grid}(t) = P_{load}(t) - P_{batt\\_dis}(t) + P_{batt\\_ch}(t)$$\n\nEnergy Continuity (SoC):$$E(t+1) = E(t) + P_{batt\\_ch}(t) \\eta_{ch} \\Delta t - \\frac{P_{batt\\_dis}(t) \\Delta t}{\\eta_{dis}}$$\n\nCapacity Limits:$$E_{min} \\le E(t) \\le E_{max}$$$$0 \\le P_{batt\\_ch}(t) \\le P_{converter\\_max}$$$$0 \\le P_{batt\\_dis}(t) \\le P_{converter\\_max}$$\n\n\n\n4.2 Terminal Constraints for Rolling Horizon\n\n\n\nSince we cannot solve for the whole month at once (forecast accuracy degrades), we solve for a 24-48 hour horizon. However, a short horizon can lead to \"greedy\" depletion.\n\nTerminal Energy Constraint: $E(T) \\ge E_{reserve}$. Forces the battery to end the day with enough energy to handle tomorrow's predicted volatility.\n\nTerminal Peak Cost: Add a cost term to the objective function representing the expected future value of the peak.\n\n\n\n5. Reinforcement Learning (RL): The Adaptive Controller\n\n\n\nWhile MILP is powerful, it is brittle to forecast errors. Reinforcement Learning (RL) creates a robust policy that maps states to actions, learning to manage risk implicitly.\n\n\n\n5.1 The Sparse Reward Problem\n\n\n\nThe central difficulty in training RL for peak shaving is Sparse Rewards. The agent only sees the \"Demand Charge\" penalty once a month. For the other 29 days, the feedback loop is broken.\n\nSymptom: The agent acts randomly or optimizes only for the dense reward (energy arbitrage), leading to \"shaving all day.\"\n\n\n\n5.2 Reward Shaping Strategy\n\n\n\nTo fix this, we must construct a Synthetic Reward Function that provides feedback at every time step $t$.23\n\n\n\n$$R_t = R_{energy} + R_{peak\\_tracking} + R_{degradation}$$\n\nPeak Tracking Reward:$$R_{peak\\_tracking} = - \\lambda_{penalty} \\cdot \\max(0, P_{grid}(t) - P_{max\\_so\\_far})$$\n\nMechanism: This term punishes the agent immediately and heavily whenever it allows the grid load to exceed the \"watermark\" set by previous days. This creates a continuous \"electric fence\" around the current peak.25\n\nDegradation Cost (The Idle Incentive):$$R_{degradation} = - C_{wear} \\cdot |P_{batt}(t)|$$\n\nMechanism: By imposing a small cost on every action, the agent learns that doing nothing (Idling) is better than doing something low-value. This is the direct cure for \"shaving all day.\" If the arbitrage spread or peak reduction value doesn't exceed $C_{wear}$, the optimal action is to sit still.26\n\n\n\n5.3 Algorithm Selection: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)\n\n\n\nFor battery control, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is the recommended algorithm over DQN or PPO.27\n\nContinuous Action Space: SAC outputs a continuous value (e.g., \"Discharge 34.5 kW\") rather than discrete steps (\"Discharge 30kW\" or \"40kW\"). This precision is vital for hitting exact peak targets without under-shaving or over-discharging.\n\nEntropy Regularization: SAC encourages exploration, preventing the agent from getting stuck in a local optimum (e.g., \"never discharge\") early in training.\n\n\n\n6. Coincident Peak (CP) Strategies\n\n\n\nIn jurisdictions like ERCOT (4CP), PJM (5CP), or IESO (Global Adjustment), the demand charge is based on the grid's peak, not the customer's. This requires a fundamentally different logic path.\n\n\n\n6.1 Data Requirements for CP\n\n\n\nThe customer's internal load data is irrelevant for predicting the CP event (though relevant for managing it). The AI must ingest:\n\nISO/RTO Load Forecasts: API feeds from the grid operator (e.g., PJM Data Miner).\n\nGrid-Scale Weather: Temperature forecasts for major load centers (e.g., Dallas/Houston for ERCOT 4CP).\n\n\n\n6.2 \"All-In\" Dispatch Logic\n\n\n\nWhen a CP event is probable, the objective function shifts from \"Efficiency\" to \"Maximum Impact.\"\n\nThreshold: If $Forecast_{ISO} > P_{threshold}$ (e.g., top 1% of historical loads), trigger CP Mode.\n\nAction: Discharge at maximum rated power ($P_{max}$) regardless of building load (up to the point of zero net export, unless export is compensated).\n\nProbabilistic Dispatch: Since CP timing is uncertain, the AI uses a \"Shotgun Approach,\" discharging during the probable 3-4 hour window. The cost of \"wasting\" a cycle on a false alarm is negligible compared to the risk of missing the CP event, which can cost hundreds of dollars per kW.29\n\n\n\n7. Battery Degradation and Life Cycle Management\n\n\n\nA BESS is a depreciating asset. Every cycle consumes a portion of its finite life. The \"shaving all day\" behavior is not just operationally inefficient; it is financially destructive.\n\n\n\n7.1 Degradation Physics\n\n\n\nCycle Aging: Caused by the mechanical stress of lithium ions intercalating into the anode/cathode. Proportional to throughput and Depth of Discharge (DoD).\n\nCalendar Aging: Caused by parasitic chemical reactions, accelerated by high State of Charge (SoC) and temperature.\n\n\n\n7.2 Cost Integration\n\n\n\nTo prevent \"busy work,\" the AI needs a Hurdle Rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n$$Cost_{throughput} = \\frac{\\text{Battery Replacement Cost}}{\\text{Total Lifetime Energy Throughput}}$$\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nCost: $\\$500/kWh_{cap}$\n\nLife: 4000 cycles\n\nThroughput Cost $\\approx \\$0.06/kWh$.\n\nIf the AI attempts to shave a load spike that saves only $\\$0.04/kWh$ in demand charges (because it’s a non-peak day), the equation $Savings - Cost_{throughput}$ becomes negative. The optimizer will correctly choose to Idle. This mathematical \"friction\" is the mechanism that stops continuous discharging.30\n\n\n\n8. Implementation Guide\n\n\n\nTo implement this correctly using the Python ecosystem:\n\nOptimization Engine: Use Pyomo or PuLP to build the MILP formulation described in Section 4. Connect it to a solver like CBC (open source) or Gurobi (commercial).\n\nWhy? Symbolic modeling allows you to explicitly write the constraint model.peak >= model.grid_import[t].\n\nForecasting: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the LSTM models.\n\nWhy? Deep learning libraries handle the complex sequence data of load profiles.\n\nData Pipeline: Use Pandas for resampling interval data (e.g., df.resample('15T').mean()) and Scikit-Learn for preprocessing (scaling).\n\n\n\nSummary of the Fix\n\n\n\nThe transition from \"shaving all day\" to \"intelligent peaking\" requires:\n\nAwareness: Ingesting \"Peak-So-Far\" and \"Billing Cycle Progress\" features.\n\nValuation: Implementing a \"Peak Tracking\" reward function that punishes new maximums.\n\nFriction: Adding degradation costs to penalize low-value discharging.\n\nMath: Using MILP or Shaped RL to linearize the max-function and optimize for the billing determinant, not just energy volume.\n\nBy feeding the AI these specific mathematical constraints and data features, it will naturally converge on the optimal strategy: periods of dormancy punctuated by decisive, high-power discharges during the critical monthly peak intervals.\n\n\n\nTable of Constraints for AI Input\n\n\n\nConstraint / Feature\n\nSource\n\nData Type\n\nFunction in Optimization\n\nPeak-So-Far\n\nCalculated from Meter Data\n\nFloat (kW)\n\nSets the \"floor\" for peak shaving.

    "content": "------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 1 — PURPOSE OF THE FINANCIAL MODEL\n\n1.1 Purpose This manual defines the financial equations, lifecycle cost models, incentive logic, rate-structure modeling, degradation-adjusted economics, loan structures, and AI behavioral rules required to evaluate the economic performance of a commercial battery energy storage system (BESS). The purpose is to give AI a deterministic, engineering-accurate financial framework that:\n\nCalculates savings correctly Determines cashflow impacts Evaluates incentives Runs NPV, IRR, and payback properly Prevents inflated or impossible financial outcomes Explains results clearly\n\n1.2 Audience This manual is designed for use inside an AI-enabled energy modeling tool supporting: Sales teams Engineers DR aggregators ESCO modelers Finance partners\n\n1.3 Modeling Requirements The financial engine must: Use deterministic formulas Respect technical limits from PDF #1 and #2 Enforce tariff rules Enforce incentive rules Avoid double-counting Adjust cashflows for degradation Handle loan structures correctly Apply discount rates consistently Report uncertainty transparently\n\n\n\nSECTION 2 — COMPONENTS OF ANNUAL SAVINGS\n\n2.1 Annual Savings Annual savings come from five major categories:\n\nDemand charge savings Arbitrage savings Demand response revenue Tariff migration value Operational improvements (HVAC interactions optional)\n\nAnnual savings must be reduced by: Degradation losses O&M expenses Cycle penalties (if used) Loan repayment (in financed scenarios)\n\n2.2 Demand Charge Savings Demand charges are based on the highest peak demand in the billing cycle, not multiple periods.\n\nDemandSavings = PeakReduction × DemandCharge × 12\n\nWhere PeakReduction is determined from the peak-shaving model.\n\nAI must never allow demand savings from multiple TOU categories.\n\n2.3 Arbitrage Savings Arbitrage revenue:\n\nArbitrageSavings = Delivered_kWh_per_day × 365 × (PeakRate − OffPeakRate)\n\nConstraints: Spread must be positive Battery must recharge Cycles per day must be below warranty limits\n\nAI must not assume arbitrage in multiple periods.\n\n2.4 Demand Response Revenue DRRevenue = CommittedKW × EventHours × NumEvents × ProgramRate\n\nIf DR includes capacity payments: CapacityPayment = CommittedKW × MonthlyRate × 12\n\nAI must model DR conflicts with arbitrage and shaving.\n\n2.5 Tariff Migration Savings Tariff migration occurs when battery enables a more favorable tariff.\n\nMigrationSavings = AnnualBill_Base − AnnualBill_WithBattery\n\nAI must recompute both full bills.\n\n\n\nSECTION 3 — COST STRUCTURE: CAPEX, OPEX, FINANCING\n\n3.1 Total CAPEX Components AI must sum:\n\nBattery modules Inverter / PCS hardware Switchgear Electrical infrastructure Controls Software Construction labor Permitting Engineering Commissioning Sales tax\n\nCAPEX must never include incentives.\n\n3.2 Operating Expenses Annual operating costs include:\n\nEMS software license Ongoing monitoring Preventative maintenance Insurance Lifecycle replacement accrual Performance testing Battery augmentation (if needed)\n\nTypical O&M: 1–3% of CAPEX annually.\n\n3.3 Cycle Degradation Cost Batteries lose capacity through cycling. A cycle cost can be included:\n\nCycleCost = ReplacementCost / (ExpectedCycleLife)\n\nAnnualCycleCost = CycleCost × CyclesPerYear\n\nAI must include cycle penalties if cycles > 365/year.\n\n3.4 Replacement Cost If analysis horizon exceeds battery life (e.g., 10-year analysis, 7-year life), AI must apply replacement cost:\n\nReplacementCost occurs in Year_LifeEnd DiscountedReplacement = ReplacementCost / (1 + r)^(LifeEnd)\n\nReplacement cost must appear as a negative cashflow.\n\n3.5 Salvage Value If battery retains value at the end of analysis:\n\nSalvageValue = RemainingCapacityValue / (1 + r)^N\n\nAI must not inflate salvage value.\n\n\n\nSECTION 4 — PAYBACK METRICS\n\n4.1 Simple Payback simple_payback = NetCAPEX / NetAnnualSavings\n\nWhere NetCAPEX = CAPEX − incentives.\n\nAI must: Reject payback if NetAnnualSavings ≤ 0 Warn if payback > analysis horizon Reject payback if NetCAPEX ≤ 0 without modeling incentives properly\n\n4.2 Discounted Payback discounted_payback = smallest t where Σ(NetAnnualSavings / (1+r)^t) ≥ NetCAPEX\n\n4.3 Loan-Adjusted Payback When financed:\n\nLoanPayback = TotalLoanPayments / NetAnnualSavings\n\nLoan payments must replace CAPEX in numerator.\n\nAI must not combine both methods.\n\n\n\nSECTION 5 — NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV)\n\n5.1 NPV Definition NPV = −NetCAPEX + Σ(NetAnnualSavings_t / (1 + r)^t)\n\nWhere: t = year r = discount rate //must never be negative\n\n5.2 Discount Rate Selection Typical values: Commercial: 6–10% Industrial: 8–15% Risk-heavy DR: 12–20%\n\nIf discount rate missing: AI must request clarification.\n\n5.3 Degradation-Adjusted Savings NetAnnualSavings must decline as battery degrades:\n\nNetAnnualSavings_t = DemandSavings_t + ArbitrageSavings_t + DRRevenue_t − OandM_t − DegradationCost_t\n\nDegradation impacts: usable_kWh usable_kW efficiency cycle performance\n\n5.4 NPV Red Flags AI Must Catch NPV > 3 × CAPEX → suspected modeling error NPV negative but IRR high → error NPV positive but payback > analysis horizon → mismatched assumptions\n\n\n\nSECTION 6 — INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)\n\n6.1 IRR Formula Solve r such that: 0 = −NetCAPEX + Σ(NetAnnualSavings_t / (1+r)^t)\n\nAI must solve with numerical iteration.\n\n6.2 IRR Validity IRR must lie between −100% and +100%. If outside → invalid.\n\n6.3 Cases IRR Fails Negative savings first years Multiple sign changes Non-monotonic cashflows\n\nAI must respond: “IRR undefined due to cashflow characteristics.”\n\n\n\nSECTION 7 — FINANCING STRUCTURES: CEFO, OBF, LOANS\n\n7.1 CEFO Logic CEFO mirrors OBF:\n\nNo upfront cost Payments through utility bill Term cannot exceed bill savings window Must be cashflow positive Savings must exceed loan payments\n\n7.2 CEFO Eligibility AI must check: SimplePayback <= program limit LoanTerm <= max term Customer type qualifies Technology qualifies Project under max cost cap\n\n7.3 OBF Logic OBF uses similar logic but is more rigid. AI must check payback-based loan term.\n\n7.4 Loan Payment Calculation Payment = LoanAmount × (r_month / (1 − (1 + r_month)^(-TermMonths)))\n\nMonthly interest = annual interest ÷ 12.\n\n7.5 Loan Cashflow Analysis Loan reduces upfront CAPEX but adds annual payment.\n\nLoanCashflow_t = NetAnnualSavings_t − LoanPayment\n\n\n\nSECTION 8 — SGIP INCENTIVE MODELING (EXTENSIVE)\n\n8.1 SGIP Incentive Types Base incentive Equity incentive Equity resiliency incentive Step-down blocks Performance-based coupons (cycling)\n\n8.2 SGIP Base Formula SGIP = battery_kWh × incentive_rate\n\nWhere incentive_rate changes by step.\n\nTypical General Market Step 1 example: 0.50 $/Wh Step 2: 0.45 Step 3: 0.40 … etc.\n\n8.3 SGIP Equity and Resiliency Equity incentives may be: 0.85 $/Wh Resiliency incentives may be: 1.00 $/Wh+\n\nAI must ensure correct categorization.\n\n8.4 SGIP Performance-Based Incentives Performance factor PF: PF = measured discharge energy / expected discharge energy\n\nAnnualPerformancePayment = PF × cycle_energy × performance_rate\n\nAI must model cycle-based performance payments.\n\n8.5 SGIP vs ITC Basis Interaction SGIP may reduce basis for federal ITC if treated as cost-sharing grant.\n\nIf applicable: ITC_basis = CAPEX − SGIP ITC = ITC_basis × ITC_rate\n\nAI must evaluate eligibility.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBATTERY FINANCIAL MODELING MANUAL\n\nPART 2 — ITC, BILL RECONSTRUCTION, REPLACEMENT, RISK MODELING\n\nRAW STRUCTURED ENGINEERING TEXT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 9 — FEDERAL INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (ITC) MODELING\n\n9.1 Purpose of ITC Modeling The Investment Tax Credit is one of the most influential financial incentives for battery storage. ITC eligibility rules are strict and depend heavily on charging-source requirements. AI must enforce all IRS rules and avoid any incorrect tax assumptions.\n\n9.2 ITC Eligibility AI must check the following conditions:\n\nIf battery charges more than 75 percent from renewable generation (typically solar) → ITC eligible If battery is grid-charged more than 25 percent → ITC reduced or disallowed If battery is standalone without renewable pairing → not ITC eligible under standard rules (unless falling under new IRA provisions) If battery participates in arbitrage using grid power → ITC may be impacted\n\nAI must never assume ITC eligibility based solely on presence of battery.\n\n9.3 ITC Basis ITC_basis = TotalCAPEX − disallowed_incentives − grants − rebates\n\nSGIP may reduce basis depending on classification. Utility incentives sometimes reduce basis.\n\nAI must: Remove any grant-type incentive from basis Keep performance-based incentives untouched (they do not affect basis)\n\n9.4 ITC Calculation ITC_amount = ITC_basis × ITC_rate\n\nWhere ITC_rate may be: 30 percent (base) +10 percent (domestic content) +10 percent (energy community) Up to 50 percent with stackable adders\n\n9.5 Depreciation Interaction ITC reduces MACRS depreciation by half the ITC rate.\n\nDepreciableBasis = ITC_basis × (1 − ITC_rate/2)\n\nAI must enforce depreciation rules if modeling tax effects.\n\n9.6 ITC Clawback Risk If battery charging % violates rules after commissioning, ITC may be clawed back. AI must warn in scenarios where arbitrage lowers renewable charging fraction below thresholds.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — UTILITY BILL RECONSTRUCTION AND TARIFF MIGRATION\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.1 Why Full Bill Reconstruction Is Required Battery modeling fundamentally changes:\n\nPeak demand Energy usage distribution TOU timing Rate eligibility Minimum charges\n\nThus AI must reconstruct the baseline and post-battery bills for accurate savings.\n\n10.2 Baseline Bill Reconstruction BaselineBill = Σ(EnergyCharges)\n\nΣ(DemandCharges)\n\nFixedCharges\n\nRiders\n\nTaxes\n\nAI must compute:\n\nBaselineEnergyCharges = Σ(kWh(t) × Rate(t))\n\nBaselineDemandCharges = PeakDemand × DemandCharge\n\nWhere PeakDemand = max interval load in the month.\n\n10.3 Post-Battery Bill Reconstruction PostBatteryEnergyCharges = Σ(kWh_after_battery(t) × Rate(t))\n\nPostBatteryDemandCharges = (NewPeakDemand × DemandCharge)\n\nMigrationBenefit = BaselineAnnualBill − PostBatteryAnnualBill\n\n10.4 TOU Changes Some tariffs allow battery customers to switch to a more favorable TOU schedule. AI must evaluate eligibility by analyzing:\n\nLoad factor Demand thresholds Renewable pairing Battery size Customer class\n\n10.5 Rate Switching Guardrails AI must never: Assume incorrect rates Switch tariffs without eligibility Ignore seasonal differences Mix rates from different tariffs Assume fixed charges identical across tariffs\n\n10.6 Minimum Charges Many tariffs include minimum charges per month (e.g., $/kW peak load shape or fixed $/month). AI must include these.\n\n10.7 Energy vs Demand Structures AI must differentiate: Energy-only tariffs Demand-only tariffs Blended tariffs Tiered tariffs Critical peak pricing (CPP) Ratchet tariffs\n\n10.8 CPP Considerations If tariff includes CPP surcharges: Battery may reduce CPP impacts by shaving critical peaks. AI must model CPP savings separately.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 11 — BATTERY REPLACEMENT AND AUGMENTATION MODELING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.1 Replacement vs Augmentation Replacement: exchange full battery system at end of life Augmentation: add modules to restore capacity\n\nAI must know difference.\n\n11.2 Replacement Trigger Replacement required when usable capacity < threshold (typically 70–80 percent). AI must predict replacement year:\n\nReplacementYear = year t where Capacity(t) <= EOL_threshold\n\n11.3 Replacement Cost Modeling ReplacementCost may equal: Full CAPEX × replacement_fraction Where replacement_fraction often 0.4–0.7 of CAPEX due to reuse of PCS, switchgear, and installation infrastructure.\n\nDiscounted replacement cost: ReplacementCost / (1+r)^(ReplacementYear)\n\n11.4 Augmentation Modeling Augmentation adds capacity over time to maintain SOC margin for DR or shaving. AI must compute augmentation scenario when:\n\nDegradation makes duration insufficient DR commitment cannot be met Peak shaving reduction becomes insufficient\n\n11.5 Augmentation Costs AugmentationCost_kWh typically lower than initial CAPEX due to reuse of PCS.\n\nAI must express augmentation as mid-horizon capital cost.\n\n11.6 Replacement and Augmentation Interactions AI must not mix replacement and augmentation incorrectly. If both required, augmentation occurs first, replacement later.\n\n11.7 End-of-Life Salvage Value If analysis horizon ends before EOL, salvage value applies.\n\nSalvageValue = RemainingCapacity × per_kWh_residual_value\n\nDiscount to present:\n\nSalvageValue / (1+r)^N\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 12 — DEGRADATION-ADJUSTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.1 Why Degradation Matters Degradation reduces: Power capability Energy capability Efficiency Cycle life Dispatch flexibility DR eligibility\n\nAnnual savings must be adjusted downward.\n\n12.2 Adjusted Demand Savings Shave_t = min(battery_kW_t, peak_excess)\n\nbattery_kW_t decreases over time due to: Inverter aging Thermal constraints Voltage sag Manufacturer limits on aged systems\n\nDemandSavings_t = Shave_t × DemandCharge × 12\n\n12.3 Adjusted Arbitrage Savings ArbitrageSavings_t = DeliveredDaily_kWh_t × 365 × Spread\n\nWhere DeliveredDaily_kWh_t decreases over time.\n\n12.4 Adjusted DR Revenue If battery capacity decreases: CommittedKW may be reduced DR eligibility may be lost Event durations may exceed battery capability\n\nAI must lower DR revenue in later years.\n\n12.5 Adjusted O&M O&M may increase with age due to: Cooling load increase Maintenance Balancing issues Component replacements\n\n12.6 Complete Degradation Model AnnualSavings_t = DemandSavings_t\n\nArbitrageSavings_t\n\nDRRevenue_t − OandM_t − DegradationPenalty_t\n\nAI must apply this series annually into NPV calculation.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 13 — SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MODELING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.1 Purpose Battery economics are sensitive to multiple variables. AI must run sensitivity checks to determine project robustness.\n\n13.2 Sensitivity Variables Demand charge Spread Cycle life Ambient temperature Tariff changes Load shape variation Degradation rate Incentive availability Financing rates\n\n13.3 Sensitivity Methods One-at-a-time (OAT) method: vary one input ±10–20 percent.\n\nMonte Carlo (conceptual only for AI guidance): vary multiple parameters across ranges.\n\nAI must at least implement OAT.\n\n13.4 Risk Indicators RiskScore increases if: NPV extremely sensitive to spread DR revenue volatile Degradation rapid Replacement cost soon Tariff likely to change Payback near program limits\n\nAI must warn user if project economically fragile.\n\n13.5 Confidence Rating AI may assign confidence boundaries to savings based on: Data quality Load shape consistency Battery sizing match Multiple conflicting incentives Assumptions required\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 14 — EXTENDED AI GUARDRAILS FOR FINANCIAL MODELING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.1 No Inflation of Benefits AI must never: Double-count demand savings Double-count arbitrage Count arbitrage in part-peak and off-peak Add DR on top of arbitrage for same interval Ignore SOC reserves\n\n14.2 No Invalid Incentive Modeling AI must not: Apply SGIP to ineligible systems Apply ITC to grid-charging batteries Stack incentives incorrectly Claim rebates not real\n\n14.3 No Invalid Loan Modeling AI must not: Use loan term longer than program allows Ignore CEFO cashflow positivity rules Mix simple payback with loan payback Confuse CAPEX and financed costs\n\n14.4 No Incorrect Discounting AI must: Apply discount rate uniformly Discount replacement costs Discount performance incentives Apply correct annual periods\n\n14.5 No Violation of Degradation Effects AI must not: Use year-1 savings for all years Ignore end-of-life Ignore mid-life replacement\n\n14.6 Transparency Requirements AI must output: All assumptions All formulas All constraints All reductions applied Any warnings\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 15 — FULL FINANCIAL EXAMPLES\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.1 Example 1 — Battery with Shaving + Arbitrage Peak = 400 kW Demand charge = 25 Spread = 0.15 Battery = 100 kW / 400 kWh Efficiency = 90 percent\n\nDemandSavings = 30,000 ArbitrageSavings = 19,710 NPV, IRR, payback follow formulas defined.\n\n15.2 Example 2 — DR-Heavy Site Battery = 200 kW / 600 kWh DR event = 4 hours DR payment = 10 dollars per kW-hour\n\nDRRevenue = 200 × 4 × 10 × events Eligibility must be checked against duration.\n\n15.3 Example 3 — Tariff Migration Only Battery changes from E-19 to B-10. AI must rebuild entire bill.\n\n15.4 Example 4 — Replacement Year Battery degrades to 70 percent at year 7. Replacement cost applied in year 7.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 16 — IMPLEMENTATION RULES FOR AI\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.1 Required Inputs AI must require: Tariff Demand charge TOU structure Battery library Building load Analysis horizon Discount rate Financing method Incentive applicability\n\n16.2 Calculation Sequence 1 Build load model 2 Determine shaving 3 Determine arbitrage 4 Determine DR 5 Apply constraints 6 Compute annual savings 7 Apply degradation 8 Apply incentives 9 Apply replacement 10 Compute financials 11 Run sensitivities 12 Output results\n\n16.3 Output Requirements AI must output: Demand savings Arbitrage savings DR revenue O&M Replacement cost schedule NPV IRR Simple payback Polarity of assumptions Warnings Confidence level\n\n16.4 Human-Readable Explanations AI must explain: How savings calculated Which constraints applied Why battery sized this way Why incentives apply What uncertainty exists\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEND OF PDF #3 — BATTERY FINANCIAL MODELING MANUAL\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou now have 3 full technical manuals, ready for export into PDF and ingestion into your AI app library.\n\n\n\n",
