AI must always stack measures in a deterministic sequence.\n\n3.2 Order of Operations Correct order is:\n\nStep 1 — Compute baseline loads Step 2 — Apply lighting retrofit Step 3 — Apply lighting controls Step 4 — Apply HVAC optimization Step 5 — Apply HVAC equipment upgrades Step 6 — Apply battery modeling (shaving + arbitrage + DR interaction) Step 7 — Apply EV charging load Step 8 — Apply DR program modeling Step 9 — Recalculate tariff (including rate migration) Step 10 — Compute combined savings Step 11 — Apply incentive stacking Step 12 — Compute total financial metrics Step 13 — Validate\n\nAI must never deviate from this order.\n\n3.3 Why This Order Works Lighting modifies HVAC loads HVAC modifies comfort + reheat Controls modify HVAC behavior Battery modifies electricity bill but not HVAC loads EV modifies demand and TOU costs DR interacts with battery and HVAC Tariff migration depends on aggregated results\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 4 — INTERACTION BETWEEN LIGHTING AND HVAC\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.1 Lighting → HVAC Interaction Lighting reduction lowers cooling demand and increases heating demand.\n\nCoolingInteractionSavings = Lighting_kWh_reduction × CoolingFraction / HVAC_EER_equivalent\n\nHeatingInteractionPenalty = Lighting_kWh_reduction × HeatingFraction / BoilerEfficiency\n\nAI must compute these interaction effects.\n\n4.2 How Lighting Affects HVAC Savings Lighting reduces: Reheat Cooling load Supply air temperature reset potential\n\nLighting affects HVAC measures: SAT reset CHW reset Economizer operation Static pressure reset Reheat reset\n\nAI must shrink HVAC savings accordingly.\n\n4.3 Interaction Ranges Cooling-dominant climates → strong interaction (10–20% savings tied to lighting load) Heating-dominant climates → small or negative interaction Mild climates → moderate interaction\n\n4.4 Validation If combined lighting + HVAC savings > 50% of total building load → unrealistic, flag.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 5 — INTERACTION BETWEEN HVAC MEASURES\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.1 HVAC Measure Synergies HVAC measures often reinforce each other:\n\nStatic pressure reset → lowers fan energy SAT reset → reduces cooling + reheat CHW reset → improves chiller efficiency Boiler reset → reduces heating therms Economizer → reduces compressor kWh\n\n5.2 Synergistic Savings Example If SAT reset and static pressure reset applied: FanSavings_spreset = cubic CoolingSavings_satreset = linear CombinedSavings = synergy factor applied AI must apply synergy factor ~1.05–1.15\n\n5.3 Overlaps Few HVAC measures overlap: SAT reset reduces cooling, which limits CHW reset effect Static pressure reset reduces airflow, limiting SAT reset savings Boiler reset reduces reheat availability\n\nAI must subtract overlap.\n\n5.4 HVAC + Controls Measures Controls such as DCV reduce HVAC runtime, impacting CHW reset savings, SAT reset savings, and reheat savings.\n\nAI must avoid double counting.\n\n5.5 Validation If HVAC stack savings > 30% of building consumption → likely unrealistic unless poor baseline controls.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 6 — INTERACTION BETWEEN HVAC AND BATTERY\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.1 Battery → HVAC Battery storage affects electricity cost profile, not HVAC kWh consumption.\n\nAI must NOT apply HVAC load reduction due to battery.\n\n6.2 HVAC → Battery HVAC schedules heavily influence peak demand. Peak shaving must consider HVAC-driven peaks.\n\n6.3 Interaction Logic If HVAC reduces peak demand significantly → battery peak shaving potential decreases.\n\nBatteryPeakShave_new = min(Battery_kW, Peak_new − TargetPeak)\n\nAI must adopt the new reduced baseline peak for battery modeling.\n\n6.4 HVAC → DR HVAC can provide DR load shedding. Battery+HVAC DR synergy possible.\n\nAI must model coordinated dispatch during DR.\n\n6.5 Validation AI must ensure: HVAC savings do not reduce kWh eligible for battery arbitrage Battery DR does not create HVAC comfort issues\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 7 — INTERACTION BETWEEN BATTERY AND EV LOAD\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.1 Battery → EV Battery can mitigate EV demand impact. Battery may reduce: EV demand charges Transformer overload Peak impact\n\nAI must calculate battery-based peak shaving on EV loads separately.\n\n7.2 EV → Battery EV charging increases site peak → increases battery dispatch demand.\n\nBattery must have enough: Power (kW) Energy (kWh) SOC reserves\n\n7.3 Combined Load Modeling EV_peak_new = EVPeak_before_batt − min(Batt_kW, EVPeak_before_batt)\n\nBattery delivers: kWh_EV_support = min(Batt_kWh, EV_kWh_needed_for_peak)\n\n7.4 Validation If EV load exceeds battery rating by >3× → battery insufficient as mitigation.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 8 — INTERACTION BETWEEN DR AND BATTERY\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.1 DR → Battery DR event reserves must be prioritized over arbitrage.\n\nBattery must start at sufficient SOC pre-event:\n\nSOC_required = (Committed_kW × EventDuration) / E_usable\n\n8.2 Battery → DR Battery may supply full DR curtailment if appropriately sized.\n\nAI must check: Battery_kW ≥ committed_kW Battery_kWh ≥ committed_kW × event_duration\n\n8.3 Interaction Constraints Battery DR reduces arbitrage cycles. Battery DR may reduce available peak shaving.\n\nAI must update savings accordingly.\n\n8.4 Validation If battery used for DR, arbitrage savings must be reduced in modeling.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 9 — CROSS-MEASURE OPTIMIZATION LOGIC\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.1 Purpose AI must evaluate all measures together to form an optimal package.\n\n9.2 Multi-Measure Objective Choose measure bundle that maximizes: Net present value Payback IRR Demand reduction Carbon reduction Customer-specified goals\n\n9.3 Optimization Process For each measure i: Compute standalone savings Compute interactions with all previous measures Apply incentives Apply stacking rules Compute financial metrics\n\nAI must iterate through all valid combinations.\n\n9.4 Dominance Rule Measure A dominates measure B when: A has higher NPV A meets constraints B meets A has lower CAPEX A offers larger savings\n\nAI must eliminate dominated measures.\n\n9.5 Multi-Measure Feasibility AI must drop measures that: Offer small marginal savings Are redundant after previous optimizations Conflict with customer goals Exceed budget or panel capacity\n\n\n\nEND OF PART 1\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMULTI-MEASURE STACKING MANUAL\n\nPART 2 — FORMULAS, EXAMPLES, VALIDATION, AI LOGIC\n\nRAW STRUCTURED ENGINEERING TEXT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — FULL MULTI-MEASURE STACKING FORMULAS\n\n10.1 Purpose of Stacking Formulas Stacking formulas ensure all measures are evaluated in correct sequence and that savings are neither understated nor overstated.\n\n10.2 General Stacking Formula TotalSavings = Σ(BaseSavings_i × AdjustmentFactor_i) − OverlapLosses\n\nSynergyGains\n\nWhere:\n\nBaseSavings_i = savings of measure i if applied alone AdjustmentFactor_i = factor adjustment after previous measures OverlapLosses = reductions due to overlapping effects SynergyGains = additional gains from measure interaction\n\n10.3 Example Adjustment Factors Lighting retrofit reduces cooling load → reduces HVAC cooling savings. AdjustmentFactor_HVAC = 1 − CoolingInteractionFraction\n\nIf lighting reduces cooling by 15%: AdjustmentFactor_HVAC ≈ 0.85\n\n10.4 Overlap Losses Overlap occurs when two measures target the same energy stream.\n\nExamples: SAT reset and CHW reset overlap on cooling DCV and economizer overlap on ventilation air HVAC DR and HVAC optimization overlap on airflow\n\nOverlapLoss = min(Savings_A, Savings_B) × OverlapCoefficient\n\n10.5 Synergy Gains Certain measures increase the effectiveness of other measures.\n\nExamples: VFD + Static Pressure Reset SAT reset + Chilled Water Reset Battery + DR\n\nSynergyGain = Savings_A × Savings_B × SynergyCoefficient\n\nTypical SynergyCoefficient = 0.05–0.20\n\n10.6 HVAC-Lighting Interaction Formula HVAC_Interaction_AdjustedSavings = LightingSavings × InteractionFactor(CZ, building_type)\n\nWhere InteractionFactor is based on climate zone.\n\n10.7 Battery + HVAC Integration Formula BatteryPeakShave_afterHVAC = min(Battery_kW, Peak_afterHVAC − TargetPeak)\n\nBattery savings recalculated after HVAC measures applied.\n\n10.8 EV + Battery Integration Formula Battery supports EV loads: EVPeakReduced = EVPeak − min(Batt_kW, EVPeak)\n\nAI must re-evaluate EV-augmented peak.\n\n10.9 DR + Battery Integration Formula Battery DR energy: DR_EnergyRequired = Committed_kW × EventDuration\n\nBattery must supply this before arbitrage is re-modeled.\n\nArbitrageReduction = (min(DR_EnergyRequired, ArbitrageEnergy)) × Spread\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 11 — DETAILED REAL-WORLD MULTI-MEASURE EXAMPLES\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.1 Example 1 — Office Building (VAV + Boiler + Lighting + Battery)\n\nBaseline: Lighting: 250,000 kWh/yr HVAC Cooling: 450,000 kWh/yr Heating: 25,000 therms/yr Peak: 350 kW\n\nMeasures: Lighting retrofit (LED) Lighting controls HVAC static pressure reset CHW reset Boiler reset Battery (100 kW / 400 kWh)\n\nStacking:\n\nStep 1 — Lighting Retrofit LightingSavings = 250,000 − 120,000 = 130,000 CoolingReduction = 130,000 × 0.12 = 15,600 kWh HeatingPenalty = 130,000 × 0.02 = 2,600 kWh equivalent (or therms based on boiler)\n\nStep 2 — Lighting Controls (post-retrofit) LightingControlsSavings = 120,000 × 0.25 = 30,000 kWh\n\nStep 3 — HVAC Optimization Cooling load reduced by lighting: HVACSavings_adjusted = 450,000 × 0.12 × 0.85 (reduced by lighting interaction)\n\nStep 4 — Battery Modeling Peak after HVAC = 350 − 40 = 310 kW BatteryPeakShave = min(100, 310 − target) Arbitrage adjusted because HVAC reset reduces daytime load\n\nStep 5 — DR Modeling DR kW now smaller because lighting + HVAC reduce baseline load.\n\nTotal system savings must sum properly.\n\n11.2 Example 2 — Hospital (CHW plant + Steam + Lighting + DR + Battery)\n\nComplex interactions: Lighting reduces cooling → reduces chiller load HVAC resets reduce heating → reduce steam demand Battery DR must reserve SOC, reducing arbitrage DR stacked with HVAC resets Battery DR + hospital peaks overlapping\n\nAI must detect: Lighting + CHW reset + CW reset synergy Lighting + boiler reset overlap Battery DR conflict with peak shaving\n\n11.3 Example 3 — School (RTUs + Boiler + Lighting + Controls) Lighting retrofit reduces RTU cooling HVAC resets smaller because RTUs are packaged DX Boiler heating penalty moderate Demand reduction from RTU staging improves battery value\n\nAI must stack: Lighting Controls RTU advanced logic Battery\n\n11.4 Example 4 — Industrial Site (High Bay + EV fleet + Battery) High bay lighting retrofit reduces warehouse cooling load EV charging increases peak Battery mitigates EV load Battery DR reduces arbitrage potential\n\nAI must simulate battery behavior with EV fleet arrivals.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 12 — MULTI-MEASURE VALIDATION MATRIX\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.1 Purpose Ensures multi-measure models avoid double counting, incorrect stacking, or impossible combinations.\n\n12.2 Validation Test Cases\n\nTest 1 — Lighting + HVAC If lighting + HVAC savings > 50% total consumption → fail unless HID-heavy facility.\n\nTest 2 — HVAC + Battery If HVAC and battery both reduce peak for the same interval → allow only ONE savings source.\n\nTest 3 — DR + Battery If DR reduces peak and battery also reduces the same peak → apply DR first, battery second or vice versa depending on goal. Avoid double counting.\n\nTest 4 — EV + Battery If battery reduces EV peak, EV must not count DR reduction separately unless EV curtailment occurs.\n\nTest 5 — Battery DR + Arbitrage If battery used for DR, arbitrage reduced proportionally. Failure to reduce → fail.\n\nTest 6 — Boiler Reset + Lighting If boiler reset savings > heating load after lighting retrofit → fail.\n\nTest 7 — Controls + HVAC If combined controls + HVAC savings exceed thermodynamic limits → fail.\n\nTest 8 — Tariff Migration If tariff switch triggered by HVAC + lighting + battery combination → must rebuild entire bill. If not → fail.\n\nTest 9 — Incentive Stacking If incentive stacking > 100% of CAPEX → fail.\n\nTest 10 — Comfort or Safety If combination violates HVAC standards → reject.\n\n12.3 AI Response to Failures Reject combined measure Flag failure Recommend revised combination Ask for missing data Enforce conservative assumptions\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 13 — COMPLETE MULTI-MEASURE OPTIMIZATION ENGINE LOGIC\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.1 Objective Find the measure bundle that maximizes user goal (e.g., ROI, NPV, DR revenue, demand reduction).\n\n13.2 Optimization Algorithm\n\nStep 1 — Identify all feasible measures based on system type Step 2 — Calculate standalone savings Step 3 — Apply stacking order Step 4 — Recalculate loads Step 5 — Apply battery modeling Step 6 — Apply DR modeling Step 7 — Apply EV loads Step 8 — Apply tariff migration Step 9 — Compute incentive stacking Step 10 — Compute final savings and financial metrics Step 11 — Check all validation rules Step 12 — Produce sorted bundle recommendations\n\n13.3 Dominance Pruning Remove measure bundles that: Underperform across all metrics Violate constraints Cost more and save less\n\n13.4 Customer-Goal-Based Prioritization If user prioritizes: Demand Reduction → HVAC + battery prioritized DR Revenue → Battery + HVAC DR Energy Savings → Lighting + HVAC optimization Carbon Reduction → Lighting + HVAC + heat pump retrofits Capex Minimization → Controls + lighting\n\n13.5 Bundle Explanation AI must provide: What measures included Why included Why others excluded Savings breakdown Financial impacts Risks Uncertainties\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 14 — AI GUARDRAILS FOR MULTI-MEASURE STACKING\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.1 Core Rule AI must NOT double count savings under any circumstances.\n\n14.2 Lighting Guardrails Lighting savings cannot fully compound with HVAC savings Lighting + controls must apply controls to post-retrofit load Exterior lighting savings do not impact HVAC\n\n14.3 HVAC Guardrails HVAC savings cannot be added twice for overlapping measures HVAC comfort limits always enforced HVAC reset applicable only to VAV/CHW systems\n\n14.4 Battery Guardrails Battery does not reduce HVAC consumption Battery does not reduce lighting consumption Battery savings only impact cost, not physical HVAC load Battery DR must reduce arbitrage savings\n\n14.5 EV Guardrails EV peak cannot be reduced twice (battery + DR) unless distinct intervals EV diversity must remain realistic EV DR only eligible in fleet or controllable environments\n\n14.6 DR Guardrails DR must never be double counted with peak shaving DR baseline must be validated DR revenue must match performance\n\n14.7 Tariff Guardrails Tariff migration must be fully recomputed Seasonal TOU must be enforced Ratchet logic must be applied\n\n14.8 Incentive Guardrails No overlapping incentives Correct stacking order Correct basis adjustment\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 15 — SAMPLE MEASURE STACK OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI must output:\n\nCombined measure description\n\nIndividual savings\n\nCombined total savings\n\nInteraction penalties\n\nSynergy gains\n\nIncentive summary\n\nTariff modifications\n\nBattery + DR interactions\n\nFinancial summary:\n\nkWh saved\n\ntherms saved\n\npeak reduced\n\nNPV\n\nsimple payback\n\nIRR\n\nWarnings and assumptions\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEND OF PDF #9 — MULTI-MEASURE STACKING MANUAL\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n",
