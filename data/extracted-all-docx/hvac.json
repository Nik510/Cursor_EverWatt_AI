    "content": "Comprehensive HVAC Energy Audit Framework and Field Data Collection Standards for EverWatt\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe optimization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represents the single most significant opportunity for operational cost reduction and decarbonization in commercial and industrial facilities. However, the efficacy of any energy conservation measure (ECM) is fundamentally limited by the quality of the initial data upon which it is based. For EverWatt to deliver superior engineering audits that transcend simple equipment inventories, the field data collection process must evolve into a rigorous diagnostic investigation. This report establishes a standardized, exhaustive protocol for EverWatt’s HVAC audit teams, designed to bridge the gap between initial site walkthroughs and complex engineering modeling.\n\nThis framework moves beyond merely identifying what equipment is present to understanding how it operates, why it consumes energy at its current rate, and where the thermodynamic inefficiencies lie. We are not just counting units; we are profiling the metabolic rate of the building. This document is structured into distinct \"Data Collection Modules,\" each providing a field-ready checklist template embedded within a deep-dive technical analysis. This structure ensures that every data point collected has a clear engineering purpose, whether it is to calibrate a load simulation, justify a capital expenditure, or identify an immediate low-cost operational improvement. By strictly adhering to these protocols, EverWatt mitigates the risk of modeling errors, reduces the necessity for costly return site visits, and uncovers high-value savings opportunities that surface-level assessments routinely miss.\n\nPart I: Audit Safety, Tools, and Pre-Site Preparation\n\nBefore a single piece of equipment is inspected, the foundational elements of safety, access, and diagnostic capability must be established. An HVAC audit involves interaction with high-voltage electrical systems, high-pressure steam and refrigerant vessels, rotating machinery, and potentially hazardous chemical environments. The auditor’s preparedness directly correlates to the depth and safety of the audit.\n\n1.1 Field Safety Protocols and Risk Assessment\n\nThe safety of the EverWatt team is paramount. HVAC environments are dynamic and often hazardous. Auditors must navigate mechanical rooms that may have been neglected for years, presenting risks ranging from biological hazards in cooling towers to electrical arc flash potential in control panels.\n\nModule 1: Safety & Access Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Item\n\nStatus\n\nGuidance / Action Required / Rationale\n\nPPE Verified\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nMandatory: Hard hat, safety glasses (Z87+), steel-toed boots, ear protection (especially for chiller/boiler rooms >85dB), and cut-resistant gloves. Why: Mechanical rooms contain sharp sheet metal, low overhead clearances, and high noise levels that can cause long-term hearing damage.\n\nLockout/Tagout (LOTO)\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nVerify facility LOTO procedures. Crucial: Never open electrical panels (remove dead fronts) without facility electrician support. Assume all capacitors in VFDs retain lethal charge even after power is cut.\n\nConfined Space\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nIdentify plenums, tanks, crawlspaces, or air handlers large enough to enter. Rule: DO NOT ENTER without certification and facility authorization. Confined spaces can accumulate CO or displace oxygen.1\n\nRoof Access\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nCheck ladder condition, hatch security, and perimeter guarding. Avoid roof edges (<6ft) without fall protection. Context: RTU inspections often require traversing compromised roof membranes.\n\nChemical Hazards\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nNote presence of ammonia (refrigeration), hydrazine (boilers), or biocides (cooling towers). Ensure proper ventilation. Insight: Ammonia leaks are immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).\n\nAsbestos Awareness\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nIn buildings pre-1980, assume pipe insulation (especially on steam lines and boilers) is asbestos. Action: Do not disturb or scrape insulation for identification.\n\nBiological Hazards\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nCheck for standing water in drain pans (Legionella risk) or bird droppings near intakes (Histoplasmosis risk).2\n\nTechnical Rationale: Operational Safety & Liability\n\nThe operational environment of a mechanical plant is unforgiving. For instance, cooling towers are notorious breeding grounds for Legionella pneumophila if water treatment programs fail. An auditor breathing in mist from a poorly maintained tower puts themselves at risk. Similarly, high-pressure steam leaks in boiler rooms can be invisible (\"dry steam\") and capable of cutting through protective clothing instantly. The checklists provided here are not merely bureaucratic hurdles; they are life-safety requirements. Furthermore, understanding the safety status of a facility provides immediate insight into the quality of maintenance. A mechanical room littered with debris, bypassed safety switches, or missing belt guards is a leading indicator of deferred maintenance, suggesting that the HVAC equipment itself is likely operating far below its design efficiency.1\n\n1.2 Essential Diagnostic Tools for the Auditor\n\nTo move beyond a visual inspection (\"The unit is there\") to a diagnostic inspection (\"The unit is failing\"), EverWatt auditors must deploy specific diagnostic tools. The \"eyeball test\" is insufficient for energy engineering. We need quantitative data to build our baselines.\n\nInfrared (Thermal) Camera: This is indispensable for non-contact diagnostics. It allows the auditor to see temperature differentials that indicate failure.\n\nApplication: Detecting insulation voids in the building envelope, identifying overheating electrical breakers (indicating high resistance/loose connections), verifying coil performance (uniform temperature distribution vs. blocked circuits), and spotting steam trap failures (trap is hot on both sides, indicating blow-through).4\n\nCombustion Analyzer: Required for any boiler audit. A blue flame does not guarantee efficiency. We need to measure Oxygen (O2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and net stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency and excess air.6\n\nAnemometer / Manometer: These measure airflow velocity and static pressure. High static pressure drops across filters or coils indicate flow restrictions that exponentially increase fan energy consumption. The manometer is the \"blood pressure cuff\" of the airside system.8\n\nUltrasonic Flow Meter: A non-invasive method to measure fluid flow (GPM) in chilled water or hot water loops without cutting pipes. This verifies if pumps are oversized or if flow is being throttled.\n\nPower Logger / Clamp Meter: For spot-checking instantaneous voltage and amperage of motors to compare against nameplate ratings. This validates the actual load factor of the equipment.\n\nPsychrometer: Measures dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, allowing for the calculation of relative humidity and enthalpy. This is critical for assessing cooling tower performance and economizer operation.\n\nPart II: Facility Operation & Building Envelope Assessment\n\nThe HVAC system does not exist in a vacuum; it is a reactive system designed to counteract the thermal loads imposed by the building envelope and internal processes. Therefore, the audit must begin with a thorough characterization of the building itself. If we do not understand the building's physics and operation, we cannot model the baseline energy usage accurately.\n\n2.1 Facility Operation Profile\n\nThe operational profile defines the \"when\" and \"how much\" of energy consumption. A primary error in energy auditing is assuming standard operating hours (e.g., 9-5) for facilities that may have cleaning crews at night, weekend shifts, or critical loads running 24/7.\n\nModule 2: Facility & Operational Data Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry Requirement\n\nField Guidance & Technical Rationale\n\nFacility Type\n\n☐ Hospital ☐ School ☐ Office ☐ Retail ☐ Industrial ☐ Data Center\n\nRationale: Dictates ventilation codes (ASHRAE 62.1 vs 170) and internal load density. A hospital requires 100% outside air in many zones, driving massive heating/cooling loads compared to an office.10\n\nPrimary Function\n\n____________________\n\nDescribe the activity: e.g., \"Plastic Injection Molding\" vs \"Software Development.\" Why: Manufacturing creates massive internal heat gains; offices are envelope-dominated.\n\nBuilding Size\n\n____________________ sq. ft.\n\nCritical: Used to calculate Energy Use Intensity (EUI = kBtu/sq.ft./yr). If drawings aren't available, pace it out or use Google Earth.\n\nBuilding Age\n\n______ Years\n\nContext: hints at insulation standards (pre-1980 often poor) and glazing technology (single pane vs low-e).\n\nWeekly Operating Hours\n\nWeekday: ____ Weekend: ____\n\nDefine \"Occupied\" vs \"Unoccupied\" setpoints. Why: Critical for baseline energy modeling and scheduling ECMs.\n\nOccupancy Density\n\n______ People/1000sf\n\nEstimate peak vs average. Why: Humans are heat engines (~500 BTU/hr total heat). High density = high cooling load and high ventilation requirement.\n\nProcess Loads\n\n☐ Servers ☐ Medical Imaging ☐ Manufacturing ☐ Kitchens\n\nRationale: These are constant internal heat gains (base loads) unrelated to weather. They must be modeled separately from the HVAC load.10\n\nUtility Rate Structure\n\nElec: $/kWh Demand: $/kW Gas: $___/Therm\n\nFinancial Impact: ECMs that reduce peak demand (kW) are more valuable in high-demand-charge territories.\n\nMaintenance Staff\n\n____________________\n\nName/Contact. Why: Their knowledge of \"buried bodies\" (hidden problems) is invaluable.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Load Profiling and Operational Dynamics\n\nUnderstanding the \"Why\" behind these fields is crucial for the auditor.\n\nLoad Decoupling: We must separate weather-dependent loads (conduction through walls, solar gain) from base loads (lighting, servers, process equipment). A data center operates 8,760 hours a year with a massive cooling load even when it is -20°F outside due to server heat. Conversely, a school operates ~2,000 hours a year and its load is dominated by the need to heat/cool fresh air for students. Confusing these profiles leads to disastrously inaccurate energy models.\n\nScheduling Opportunities: The simplest, highest-ROI ECM is often scheduling. If a building operates 24/7 but only needs strict temperature control from 8 AM to 6 PM, implementing temperature setbacks during unoccupied hours can save 10-20% of HVAC energy immediately without buying new equipment. The auditor must ask: \"Why is this running right now?\".11\n\nUtility Rate Impact: The \"Electric Rate Schedule\" 10 dictates the financial viability of projects. If a client pays high demand charges ($/kW), thermal storage or load-shedding strategies become viable. If they pay flat rates, efficiency (kWh reduction) is the priority.\n\n2.2 Building Envelope Inspection\n\nThe envelope (walls, roof, windows, foundation) acts as the barrier to heat flow. An HVAC system is simply a machine designed to counteract the failure of the envelope to maintain interior conditions. A leaky bucket requires the tap to run constantly; sealing the bucket (the envelope) allows us to turn down the tap (the HVAC).\n\nModule 3: Envelope Integrity Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Point\n\nObservation / Data Entry\n\nWhy This Matters for the Audit\n\nWindow Type\n\n☐ Single ☐ Double ☐ Tinted ☐ Low-E\n\nPhysics: Single pane glass has a U-factor of ~1.0 (R-1). Double pane is ~0.5. This drives conduction load. Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) drives cooling load.\n\nWindow Condition\n\n☐ Sealed ☐ Drafty ☐ Fogged\n\nFogged glass means the seal is broken and the insulating gas (Argon) has escaped.\n\nDoor Seals\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Gaps Visible\n\nVisual Cue: If you can see daylight under a door, air is rushing in. This \"infiltration\" adds latent load (humidity) and sensible load.\n\nWall Insulation\n\n☐ Good ☐ Unknown ☐ Thermal Bridges\n\nUse thermal camera. Look for \"thermal bridging\"—metal studs or beams conducting heat through the wall, bypassing insulation.\n\nRoof Color/Type\n\n☐ Black (EPDM/Tar) ☐ White (TPO/PVC)\n\nCooling Load: A black roof can reach 160°F in summer, conducting massive heat into the building. A white roof stays near ambient, reducing cooling load.12\n\nRoof Insulation\n\n☐ Dry ☐ Wet/Compressed\n\nWet insulation has an R-value of nearly zero. It acts as a conductor. Identifying wet roof sections via thermal imaging is a critical finding.\n\nWall/Floor Joins\n\n☐ Sealed ☐ Drafty\n\nMajor source of infiltration. Air leaks here often bring in unconditioned, humid air, stressing the latent capacity of the AC.\n\nVestibules\n\n☐ Present ☐ Absent\n\nDo main entries have a double-door airlock? If not, wind blows conditioned air right out.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Thermal Dynamics and Infiltration\n\nInfiltration (Air Leakage): Uncontrolled air leakage forces the HVAC system to condition outside air that hasn't passed through a dedicated intake or energy recovery unit. This is the most expensive air to treat because it enters at extreme temperatures. The auditor should look for \"cobwebs moving\" near corners or verify if the building is positively pressurized (doors push open) or negatively pressurized (doors suck shut). Negative pressure sucks in unconditioned air, causing humidity problems and drafts.13\n\nSolar Heat Gain: In commercial buildings with high glass-to-wall ratios, solar gain is often the dominant cooling load. Auditors should note the orientation of glass. West-facing glass causes late-afternoon peak loads that align with peak utility pricing. Tinting or shading these windows is a prime ECM.\n\nInsulation Integrity: It is not enough to know if there is insulation; we must know its condition. Compressed fiberglass loses its R-value. Wet roof insulation not only loses thermal resistance but can destroy the roof deck. The thermal camera is the tool of choice here, revealing cold/hot spots that the naked eye misses.4\n\nPart III: Airside Systems (RTUs, AHUs, and Ductwork)\n\nThe airside system is the mechanism of heat exchange between the central plant (or refrigerant circuit) and the occupied space. It is the \"lungs\" of the building. This section covers Package Rooftop Units (RTUs), Air Handling Units (AHUs), and the distribution ductwork.\n\n3.1 Rooftop Unit (RTU) Audit\n\nRTUs are the ubiquitous workhorses of commercial HVAC, commonly found on retail, light industrial, and office buildings. They are self-contained \"package\" units.\n\nModule 4: RTU Field Data Collection\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nField Guidance / Visual Cues / Technical Note\n\nUnit Tag / ID\n\n____________________\n\nMatch to site plan (e.g., RTU-1, AC-3).\n\nMake / Model\n\n____________________\n\nEssential: Photograph the nameplate. This is the DNA of the unit.\n\nSerial Number\n\n____________________\n\nDecodes the Date of Manufacture. Age Rule: Systems >15 years are nearing end of life and are prime for replacement.15\n\nTonnage / Capacity\n\n____________________ MBH/Tons\n\n12,000 BTU/hr = 1 Ton. Look for numbers divisible by 12 in the model # (e.g., ZP060 = 60k BTU = 5 tons).\n\nCompressor Condition\n\n☐ Running ☐ Short Cycling ☐ Noisy\n\nListen: Does it turn on and off every <5 minutes? This is \"short cycling\" and kills efficiency. Check for oil stains on piping (leaks).\n\nCondenser Coil\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Dirty/Impacted ☐ Fin Damage\n\nLook for \"matting\" (a layer of dirt/cottonwood) or bent fins from hail. Dirty coils raise head pressure, increasing amp draw.\n\nEconomizer Status\n\n☐ Functioning ☐ Stuck Open ☐ Stuck Closed\n\nCritical: Is the damper stuck? Open the hood. Are wires disconnected? Is the linkage rusted? A stuck economizer is a massive energy waster.16\n\nFan Belt Condition\n\n☐ Tight ☐ Loose/Squealing ☐ Worn\n\nPush the belt: >1/2\" deflection = loose. Look for black rubber dust on the guard (slipping belt).\n\nThermostat Settings\n\nSet: ____ Actual: ____ Mode: ____\n\nIs the unit running when the building is unoccupied? Is the fan set to \"On\" (runs 24/7) instead of \"Auto\"?\n\nGas Heat\n\n☐ Present ☐ Electric Heat\n\nIf gas, check flue for soot (bad combustion). If electric, note kW.\n\nTechnical Rationale: RTU Efficiency and Failure Modes\n\nEconomizer Diagnostics: The economizer is a damper system that brings in cool outside air to cool the building without running the compressor (\"free cooling\"). It is the first component to fail and often goes unnoticed.\n\nStuck Open: If stuck open in summer, the unit pulls in 95°F/90% humidity air, overwhelming the coil and causing humidity issues and high energy bills.\n\nStuck Closed: If stuck closed in winter/spring (e.g., 55°F outside), the unit must run mechanical compressors to cool the core of the building, wasting free cooling potential.\n\nAudit Action: The auditor must physically inspect the damper linkage. If it is zip-tied shut or the actuator is hanging loose, mark it as \"Failed\".17\n\nShort Cycling: If a compressor runs for 3 minutes and shuts off, then restarts 2 minutes later, it is \"short cycling.\" This destroys the compressor (due to heat buildup in windings) and ruins efficiency (SEER) because the system never reaches steady-state operation. It indicates oversizing, low refrigerant charge (safety switch tripping), or a blocked coil.19\n\nCondenser Coils: The condenser rejects heat to the outdoors. If the coil is plugged with dirt (\"sweater\"), the refrigerant cannot condense properly. The pressure rises (head pressure), forcing the compressor to work harder and draw more amps. A 10% reduction in airflow can degrade efficiency by 5-10% and capacity by even more.15\n\n3.2 Air Handling Unit (AHU) Deep Dive\n\nAHUs are generally larger, indoor units that may be connected to a central plant (chillers/boilers) or have their own DX (Direct Expansion) cooling. They serve larger zones and have more complex controls.\n\nModule 5: AHU Detailed Inspection Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Technical Note\n\nSupply Fan Type\n\n☐ Centrifugal ☐ Axial ☐ Plenum\n\nNote if VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) is present.\n\nVFD Frequency\n\n______ Hz\n\nGolden Nugget: If the VFD display reads \"60.00 Hz\" constantly, the VFD is bypassed or the controls have failed. It is running at full speed unnecessarily.21\n\nStatic Pressure\n\nSupply: ___\" wc Return: ___\" wc\n\n\"Blood Pressure\": High supply static (>1.5\" wc for typical office) means blocked filters or closed dampers. Low static means a blown duct or broken belt.8\n\nFilter Condition\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Loaded\n\nCheck the Differential Pressure (DP) gauge (e.g., Magnehelic). >0.5\" wc drop usually means replace. High DP kills fan efficiency.22\n\nCooling Coil Valve\n\n☐ Modulating ☐ Hunting\n\nWatch the actuator. Is it constantly moving open/closed? This is \"hunting\" and wastes energy while wearing out the valve.\n\nChilled Water Temp\n\nIn: ___°F Out: ___°F\n\nDelta T: The temperature difference (ΔT) should be ~10-12°F (e.g., 44°F in, 54°F out). Low ΔT (<5°F) indicates \"Low Delta T Syndrome.\"\n\nDuct Leakage\n\n☐ Audible ☐ Visible\n\nListen for hissing. Look for unsealed joints, blown-off tape, or gaps at the unit connection.\n\nO.A. Damper\n\n% Open: ______\n\nMinimum Outside Air (O.A.) should be set for code (e.g., 10-20%). If it's 50% open on a hot day, energy is being wasted.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Airside Dynamics & Static Pressure\n\nStatic Pressure Analysis: Static pressure is the resistance the fan must overcome to move air. It is measured in inches of water column (w.c.).\n\nHigh Static: If the static pressure is high, the fan motor works harder, drawing more amps. Causes include dirty filters, crushed ducts, or fire dampers that have slammed shut.\n\nLow Static: Indicates the fan is spinning but not building pressure—likely a broken belt or a large disconnect in the supply duct.9\n\nLow Delta T Syndrome: In a chilled water system, the water is the transport medium for heat. If water enters the coil at 44°F and leaves at 46°F (ΔT = 2°F), the water is moving too fast through the coil to pick up heat (laminar flow issues or fouled coil). This forces the central plant pumps to pump massive amounts of water to do very little cooling work. It also wreaks havoc on chiller efficiency.24\n\nFilter Pressure Drop: As filters load with dirt, the pressure drop across them increases. In a system with a VFD, the fan speeds up to compensate, using more energy. In a constant volume system, airflow decreases, reducing cooling capacity. Modern \"high efficiency\" filters (MERV 13+) have higher initial pressure drops; the system must be designed to handle this penalty.25\n\nPart IV: Central Plant - Cooling Systems (Chillers & Towers)\n\nCentral plants are the heavy artillery of HVAC. They are the largest energy consumers in large facilities (hospitals, large offices, campuses). Small efficiency gains here yield massive absolute savings.\n\n4.1 Chiller Audit Protocol\n\nA chiller makes cold water. It uses a vapor-compression cycle (or absorption) to remove heat from the water and reject it to the air (air-cooled) or to a cooling tower loop (water-cooled).\n\nModule 6: Chiller Plant Data Log\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nChiller Type\n\n☐ Air Cooled ☐ Water Cooled\n\n☐ Centrifugal ☐ Screw ☐ Scroll ☐ Reciprocating. Why: Centrifugal is efficient at full load; Screw/Scroll better at part load.\n\nRefrigerant Type\n\n____________________\n\nR-134a, R-410a, R-123, R-22 (Phase out). Important for replacement strategy and environmental compliance.26\n\nCapacity\n\n______ Tons\n\nCheck nameplate. 1 Ton = 12,000 BTU/hr.\n\nEntering CHW\n\n______ °F\n\nCHW: Chilled Water. Standard return temp is ~54°F.\n\nLeaving CHW\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard supply temp is ~44°F. A 10°F ΔT is design standard.\n\nEntering CW\n\n______ °F\n\nCW: Condenser Water (for water-cooled). Standard entering from tower is ~85°F (depends on wet bulb).\n\nLeaving CW\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard leaving to tower is ~95°F.\n\nCompressor Amps\n\nL1: __ L2: __ L3: __\n\nCompare to RLA (Rated Load Amps). Imbalance across phases indicates electrical issues.\n\nApproach Temp\n\n______ °F\n\nCritical Efficiency Metric. (Leaving Water Temp - Saturated Refrigerant Temp). See analysis below.\n\nNoise/Vibration\n\n☐ Smooth ☐ Grinding\n\nGrinding indicates bearing failure. High pitched whine might be \"surge\" (aerodynamic stall in centrifugal chillers).\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Sweating\n\nSweating evaporator barrel means insulation failure, gaining heat from the mechanical room.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Chiller Physics & Approach Temperature\n\nThe Approach Temperature is the most vital metric for diagnosing heat exchanger health in a chiller.\n\nEvaporator Approach: The difference between the Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and the Refrigerant Saturation Temperature in the evaporator.\n\nFormula: $T_{approach} = T_{leaving\\_water} - T_{refrigerant}$\n\nTarget: < 2°F to 3°F for modern chillers.\n\nImplication: If the approach is high (e.g., 8°F), it means heat is not transferring well from the water to the refrigerant. This is caused by scale/fouling on the tubes or low refrigerant charge. The compressor must work harder to lower the refrigerant temperature further to achieve the desired water temperature.27\n\nCondenser Approach: The difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and the Saturated Condensing Temperature.\n\nTarget: < 1°F to 4°F.\n\nImplication: High approach here means the chiller cannot get rid of its heat. This is almost always due to dirty tubes (mud/algae/scale from the cooling tower). Every 1°F increase in condenser temperature can increase compressor energy use by ~1.5%.29\n\nLift: The pressure difference between the evaporator and condenser. The compressor's job is to pump against this lift. Lowering the condenser water temperature (via cooling tower optimization) reduces lift and significantly drops energy usage.\n\n4.2 Cooling Tower Inspection\n\nThe cooling tower is the heat rejection device. It relies on evaporation to cool the condenser water. Its performance is tethered to the Wet Bulb Temperature of the ambient air.\n\nModule 7: Cooling Tower Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Visual Cues\n\nDraft Type\n\n☐ Induced ☐ Forced\n\nFan on top pulling air up (Induced) vs Fan on side blowing in (Forced).\n\nFill Condition\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Scaled/Clogged\n\n\"Fill\" is the honeycomb media inside. Scale buildup blocks air/water contact, destroying efficiency. 30\n\nWater Distribution\n\n☐ Uniform ☐ Dry Spots\n\nLook at the nozzles spraying water. Are parts of the fill dry? This reduces cooling capacity.\n\nFan Control\n\n☐ VFD ☐ On/Off ☐ 2-Speed\n\nVFD Opportunity: VFDs on tower fans offer massive savings by allowing the fan speed to float with the load and wet-bulb temperature.\n\nBleed/Blowdown\n\n☐ Auto ☐ Manual\n\nIs water constantly overflowing? Indicates float valve failure. Conductivity meter should control bleed to manage solids.\n\nDrift Eliminators\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Broken/Missing\n\nZig-zag slats that prevent water droplets from escaping. Saves water and chemicals.\n\nStructure\n\n☐ Good ☐ Corroded\n\nCheck for rust on metal towers or rot on wood towers.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Psychrometrics of Heat Rejection\n\nRange: The temperature difference between hot water entering the tower and cold water leaving (Standard ~10°F). $Range = T_{hot\\_in} - T_{cold\\_out}$.\n\nApproach: The difference between the cold water leaving the tower and the ambient Wet Bulb temperature. $Approach = T_{cold\\_out} - T_{wet\\_bulb}$.\n\nRule of Thumb: A tower cannot cool water below the wet bulb temperature. A \"good\" approach is 5°F to 7°F. If the wet bulb is 75°F, the best cold water temp you can theoretically get is ~80-82°F.\n\nAudit Check: If the local Wet Bulb is 70°F and the tower is supplying 85°F water, the approach is 15°F. This indicates poor performance—likely fouled fill, poor airflow, or bad water distribution.31\n\nCycles of Concentration: A measure of water efficiency. It compares the concentration of dissolved solids in the tower water vs. the makeup water. Higher cycles mean less water waste, but require better chemical treatment to prevent scale.\n\nVisual Cue: White scaling on the fill media acts as an insulator and blocks airflow. This forces the tower fan to run at 100% speed to try and maintain setpoint, wasting huge amounts of energy.30\n\nPart V: Central Plant - Heating Systems (Boilers & Steam)\n\nHeating systems are critical for comfort and process (sterilization, cooking), but are often oversized and inefficiently controlled.\n\n5.1 Boiler Audit Data\n\nBoilers come in two main flavors: Steam and Hot Water (Hydronic). Steam is common in older buildings and hospitals; Hot Water is common in modern offices.\n\nModule 8: Boiler System Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nType\n\n☐ Steam ☐ Hot Water\n\n☐ Fire Tube ☐ Water Tube ☐ Condensing ☐ Cast Iron.\n\nFuel Source\n\n☐ Nat. Gas ☐ Propane ☐ Oil\n\n☐ Electric.\n\nInput Capacity\n\n______ MBH\n\n1 Boiler HP ≈ 33,475 BTU/hr. Check nameplate.\n\nCombustion Analysis\n\nO2: __% CO: __ppm\n\nCritical: Must use combustion analyzer. See analysis below.\n\nStack Temp\n\n______ °F\n\nHigh stack temp = heat wasted up the chimney. (Net Stack Temp = Flue Temp - Room Temp).\n\nOperating Pressure/Temp\n\n___ psi / ___ °F\n\nIs it maintaining setpoint? Is the pressure relief valve leaking?\n\nCycles/Hour\n\n______\n\nFrequent on/off (<10 mins) = short cycling. Indicates oversizing or poor control bandwidth.\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Good ☐ Missing/Hot\n\nCheck boiler shell and piping. If you can't touch it (>140°F), it's losing energy to the room.\n\nSteam Traps\n\n☐ Functioning ☐ Blowing\n\nSteam Systems Only: Listen for hissing (blowing through). A failed open trap wastes thousands of dollars a year.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Combustion Efficiency & Stack Physics\n\nBoiler efficiency is determined by how well it burns fuel and transfers that heat to the water.\n\nExcess Air (O2): Combustion requires oxygen. For natural gas, we target ~3% to 5% O2 in the flue gas.\n\nToo High (>10%): We are bringing in too much cold air, heating it up, and sending it out the stack. This is a major efficiency loss.\n\nToo Low (<2%): Dangerous. Incomplete combustion occurs, creating Carbon Monoxide (CO) and soot (unburned fuel). This is a safety hazard.32\n\nStack Temperature: The flue gas must be hot enough to create draft and prevent condensation (unless it's a condensing boiler), but not too hot.\n\nRule of Thumb: Stack temp should be ~ambient + 300°F for standard boilers. If stack temp is 500°F+, the boiler tubes are likely sooted (fouled) on the fire side or scaled on the water side, insulating the water from the heat.33\n\nCondensing Boilers: These high-efficiency units (90%+) are designed to extract latent heat from water vapor in the flue gas. To do this, they must have low return water temperatures (<130°F) to cause condensation.\n\nAudit Check: If a facility has expensive condensing boilers but runs a standard 180°F supply / 160°F return loop, the boilers will not condense. They are operating at standard efficiency (80-82%), wasting the investment. This is a very common design/operation failure.34\n\n5.2 Domestic Hot Water (DHW)\n\nModule 9: DHW Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance\n\nSystem Type\n\n☐ Storage ☐ Tankless\n\n☐ Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH).\n\nTemp Setting\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard is 120°F (140°F for kitchens/hospitals). >140°F is scald hazard and energy waste.\n\nRecirculation Pump\n\n☐ Timer ☐ 24/7\n\n24/7 recirculation keeps pipes hot but wastes heat loss through the loop. A timer or aquastat is a simple ECM.\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Pipe ☐ Tank\n\nFirst 5ft of pipe from tank must be insulated (heat trap). Tank wrap needed for older units.\n\nPart VI: Hydronics & Distribution (Pumps, Pipes, Valves)\n\nMoving energy (water/air) uses energy. Inefficient pumping can account for 20-30% of HVAC usage. We must assess if the pumps are fighting the system or working with it.\n\n6.1 Pump Audit\n\nModule 10: Pump Station Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nApplication\n\n☐ CHW ☐ HW ☐ CW\n\nChilled, Hot, or Condenser Water.\n\nControl\n\n☐ VFD ☐ Constant Speed\n\nCheck if VFD is present but manually bypassed (running 60Hz).\n\nPressure Gauges\n\nSuction: __ Discharge: __\n\nCritical: Calculate Pump Head ($Head = (Discharge\\_psi - Suction\\_psi) \\times 2.31$). This validates the pump curve.\n\nValves (Triple Duty)\n\n☐ 100% Open ☐ Throttled\n\nMajor Waste: If the discharge valve is 50% closed (\"throttled\") to balance flow, it is like driving with the parking brake on. We are burning energy to overcome artificial resistance. Solution: Trim impeller or use VFD.\n\nNoise\n\n☐ Silent ☐ Gravel/Rocks\n\n\"Pumping rocks\" sound = Cavitation.\n\nSeal Condition\n\n☐ Dry ☐ Leaking\n\nWater on floor under coupler? Indicates mechanical seal failure.\n\nMotor\n\n______ HP / ______ RPM\n\nRecord nameplate data.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Pumping Dynamics & Cavitation\n\nCavitation: This occurs when pressure at the suction eye of the impeller falls below the water's vapor pressure. The water essentially \"boils\" at room temperature, creating vapor bubbles. When these bubbles move to the high-pressure discharge side, they implode violently.\n\nConsequences: Destroys impellers (pitting), destroys seals, creates noise, and reduces flow.\n\nVisual/Audio Cue: Sounds like marbles or gravel rattling in the pipe. Often caused by clogged suction strainers or poor system design (Net Positive Suction Head issue).35\n\nDeadhead Pressure: The pressure when the pump runs against a closed valve (zero flow). Measuring this and comparing it to the manufacturer's pump curve verifies if the impeller is worn or has been trimmed.\n\nThrottling: Using a valve to reduce flow consumes near-full pump energy while doing less work. This is a prime candidate for a VFD retrofit. The VFD allows you to open the valve and slow the pump down, saving energy according to the Affinity Laws (Power varies with the cube of speed).37\n\nPart VII: Building Automation & Controls (BMS)\n\nThe Building Management System (BMS) or Energy Management System (EMS) is the \"brain\" of the HVAC system. A confused brain wastes energy, no matter how efficient the \"muscles\" (equipment) are.\n\nModule 11: BMS / Controls Audit Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Item\n\nObservation\n\nTechnical Guidance / \"The Why\"\n\nInterface\n\n☐ Modern GUI ☐ Legacy Text\n\nOlder systems may lack optimization logic (reset schedules, optimal start).\n\nOverrides\n\n______ % of points\n\nLook for \"Hand\" symbols, \"Operator\" priority, or forced values. Rule: If >10-20% of valves/fans are overridden \"Open,\" the auto-logic has failed. The system is manual.\n\nSchedules\n\n☐ Aligned ☐ 24/7\n\nDo schedules match actual occupancy? Check for \"temporary\" overrides left for years (e.g., \"Party Mode\" from 2019).\n\nSensor Calibration\n\n☐ Realistic ☐ Error\n\nE.g., Outside Air Temp reading 120°F in winter or 0°F in summer. Failed sensors cause economizers and reset schedules to malfunction completely.38\n\nSetpoints\n\nCool: __ Heat: __\n\nDeadband: Are heating/cooling setpoints too close (e.g., Heat to 70, Cool to 71)? This causes simultaneous heating and cooling (fighting), a massive waste. Target >4°F deadband.\n\nReset Schedules\n\n☐ Active ☐ Static\n\nDoes the hot water temp drop when it's warm outside? Does static pressure drop when VAVs close? Static setpoints waste energy.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Control Logic Failures\n\nSimultaneous Heating & Cooling: A classic waste found in VAV systems. One VAV box enters heating mode (reheat coil on), raising the return air temp. The central AHU sees this warm return air and ramps up cooling to compensate. The boiler and chiller effectively fight each other, and the utility meter spins.\n\nSensor Drift: Sensors drift over time. A CO2 sensor reading 2000ppm (when actual is 400ppm) will force outside air dampers open to 100%, causing huge heating/cooling loads. An outdoor air sensor reading 50°F when it is really 80°F will open the economizer, flooding the building with humid heat.\n\nOptimized Start/Stop: Does the system start at 6 AM fixed? Or does it calculate start time based on indoor/outdoor temp? \"Optimized Start\" can save hundreds of hours of run time per year.\n\nPart VIII: Specialized Environments (Server Rooms & Labs)\n\nThese areas have high energy density and critical requirements. They often override standard building controls.\n\nModule 12: Mission Critical Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance\n\nTemp Setpoint\n\n______ °F\n\nServers are often okay at 75-80°F (ASHRAE TC 9.9 guidelines). Many legacy server rooms cool to 65°F unnecessarily. Raising setpoints saves cooling energy.\n\nCRAC Units\n\n☐ Downflow ☐ Upflow\n\nComputer Room Air Conditioners. Check floor tiles.\n\nAirflow Management\n\n☐ Hot/Cold Aisle ☐ Chaotic\n\nAre perforated tiles located only in cold aisles (front of servers)? Are there blanks in the racks?\n\nCable Management\n\n☐ Tidy ☐ Blocked\n\nCables blocking rear rack exhaust cause hot spots, forcing server fans to run at 100% RPM.39\n\nRedundancy\n\nN+1 present?\n\nEnsure backup cooling doesn't mean running all units at 100% capacity simultaneously. They should stage or run at part-load.\n\nPart IX: Advanced Diagnostics & IoT Integration\n\nModern auditing can be augmented by the temporary installation of IoT sensors to capture data over time (1-2 weeks), rather than just a snapshot.\n\n9.1 IoT Data Logging Strategy\n\nCurrent Transducers (CTs): Clip onto motor leads to log amperage. This reveals the load profile. Is the motor running 24/7? Is it variable or constant?.40\n\nTemp/Humidity Loggers: Place in spaces to verify thermostat accuracy and comfort. Place in supply/return ducts to verify ΔT and economizer operation over a week.\n\nVibration Sensors: Magnetic sensors on pumps/motors. increasing vibration trends predict bearing failure or cavitation before it becomes audible.41\n\n9.2 Field Rules of Thumb for Auditors\n\nUse these to sanity-check your findings in real-time.\n\nCooling Load: ~400-500 sq. ft. per Ton for average offices. If a 2,000 sq. ft. office has a 10-ton unit (200 sq. ft./ton), it is grossly oversized.42\n\nAirflow: ~400 CFM per Ton of cooling.\n\nChiller Flow: ~2.4 GPM per Ton for Chilled Water; ~3.0 GPM per Ton for Condenser Water.42\n\nMotor Amps: Full load amps (FLA) roughly equals Horsepower × 1.2 (for 460V 3-phase). If a 10HP motor is drawing 2 amps, it's doing no work (broken belt/coupling).\n\n9.3 Visual Deficiencies Guide\n\nSoot on Boiler Vent: Incomplete combustion / lack of air / clogged burner.\n\nIce on DX Coil: Low airflow, dirty filter, or low refrigerant charge.\n\nOil Stains on Piping: Refrigerant leak location.\n\nDimming Lights on Start-up: Compressor \"Hard Start\"—electrical issues, bad capacitor, or locked rotor.43\n\nPart X: Post-Audit Analysis & Reporting\n\nThe value of the audit is in the translation of field data into actionable ECMs. The data collected in Modules 1-12 feeds directly into the engineering calculations.\n\nModule 13: Analysis Preparation\n\nData Point Collected\n\nECM Opportunity\n\nCalculation Methodology\n\nStuck Economizer\n\nAirside Economizer Repair\n\nBin analysis using local weather data to calculate hours of free cooling lost.\n\nConstant Volume Fan\n\nVFD Retrofit\n\nFan Laws: Power varies with the cube of speed ($P_2 = P_1 \\times (N_2/N_1)^3$). 20% speed reduction = 50% energy savings.\n\nHigh Discharge Pressure\n\nPump Impeller Trimming\n\nPump Laws. Analyze pump curve vs system curve to find new operating point.\n\nLighting Schedule\n\nBMS Scheduling\n\nSimple runtime reduction (kW × hours saved).\n\nLow Delta T\n\nCoil Cleaning / Valve Repair\n\nIncreases chiller efficiency and reduces pump energy.\n\n10.1 Required Documentation for Engineering Handoff\n\nTo close the audit loop, ensure the following are collected before leaving the site:\n\n[ ] 12-36 months of utility bills (Electric, Gas, Water).10\n\n[ ] Mechanical schedules (As-built drawings) - scan or photo.\n\n[ ] TAB (Test, Adjust, Balance) reports (provides design airflow baselines).\n\n[ ] Photos of every nameplate and every visual deficiency (macro and wide shots).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis framework provides EverWatt with a structured, rigorous methodology for conducting HVAC audits. By moving beyond a simple \"inventory\" to a \"diagnostic assessment,\" EverWatt positions itself to identify deeper, more lucrative energy savings for clients. The integration of visual inspection, tool-based measurement, and control-logic review ensures that the final Scope of Work is engineered based on reality, not assumptions. Use the Modules provided as the standard field templates for all future engagements.\n\nWorks cited\n\nHVAC Compliance & Safety Standards: Essential Guide for U.S. Field Service Businesses, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.fieldax.com/blog/hvac-compliance-safety-standards-us-guide/\n\nASHRAE Standards and Guidelines, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/ashrae-standards-and-guidelines\n\nTop HVAC Quality Assurance Tips and Strategies for 2025 - ServiceTitan, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/hvac-quality-assurance\n\nThermographic Inspections - Department of Energy, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermographic-inspections\n\nThermal Imaging for Energy Auditing & Building Inspection - Flir, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.flir.com/instruments/energy-audit/\n\nCombustion Analysis - Gerard Home Inspection, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.gerardhomeinspection.com/combustion-analysis\n\nCombustion Analysis: Readings, Ratings, & Results - Raeco Rents, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.raecorents.com/blog/how-to-do-combustion-anaysis\n\naccessed December 10, 2025, https://tsi.com/hvac-consultant/learn/why-accurate-duct-static-pressure-measurement-is-critical-for-hvac-efficiency#:~:text=It's%20a%20measure%20of%20how,design%20or%20improperly%20sized%20components.\n\nStatic Pressure in HVAC Systems - Lennox, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.lennox.com/residential/buyers-guide/guide-to-hvac/glossary/what-is-static-pressure-in-hvac\n\nEverWatt_HVAC_PreAssessment_TrainingVersion_(Checklist).docx\n\nChecklists of Energy-Saving Measures, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/save-energy-commercial-buildings/ways-save/checklists\n\nASHRAE Level 2 energy audit checklist template - Lumiform, accessed December 10, 2025, https://lumiformapp.com/templates/ashrae-level-2-energy-audit-checklist_35438\n\nEnergy Audit Checklist: Essential Steps for a Comprehensive Energy Assessment - Performance Validation, accessed December 10, 2025, https://perfval.com/energy-audit-checklist/\n\nDo-It-Yourself Home Energy Assessments, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/do-it-yourself-home-energy-assessments\n\n10 Essential RTU Tune-up Checklist - High Efficiency Cooling & Heating Inc., accessed December 10, 2025, https://highefficiencyinc.com/10-essential-rtu-tune-up-checklist/\n\nField Economizer Retrofit Guide - kele.com, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.kele.com/content/blog/field-economizer-retrofit-guide\n\nEconomizers in Air Handling Systems - CED Engineering, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.cedengineering.com/userfiles/M02-014%20-%20Economizers%20in%20Air%20Handling%20Systems%20-%20US.pdf\n\nEconomizer Basics: Who Uses Them, Where They're Required, and Why They Wind Up in Claims - Alpine Intel, accessed December 10, 2025, https://alpineintel.com/resource/economizer-basics-who-uses-them-where-theyre-required-and-why-they-wind-up-in-claims/\n\nWhat is AC Short Cycling, and How Can It Harm Your Unit?, accessed December 10, 2025, https://qualtechachtg.com/what-is-ac-short-cycling/\n\nAC Compressor Short Cycling: Diagnosing Rapid On/Off Cycles During Summer Heat, accessed December 10, 2025, https://energy-one.com/central-air-conditioner-short-cycling-diagnosis-summer-heat/\n\nESL AIR HANDLING UNITS AIR HANDLER START-UP CHECKLIST - Johnson Controls, accessed December 10, 2025, https://webselect.johnsoncontrols.com/Products-ESL/Docs/ESLStart-upChecklist.pdf\n\nMERV Air Filter Pressure Drop Chart - Filterbuy.com, accessed December 10, 2025, https://filterbuy.com/resources/air-filter-basics/merv-air-filter-pressure-drop-chart/\n\nWhat is static pressure and how does static pressure affect the performance of an HVAC system?

    "content": "Comprehensive HVAC Energy Audit Framework and Field Data Collection Standards for EverWatt\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe optimization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represents the single most significant opportunity for operational cost reduction and decarbonization in commercial and industrial facilities. However, the efficacy of any energy conservation measure (ECM) is fundamentally limited by the quality of the initial data upon which it is based. For EverWatt to deliver superior engineering audits that transcend simple equipment inventories, the field data collection process must evolve into a rigorous diagnostic investigation. This report establishes a standardized, exhaustive protocol for EverWatt’s HVAC audit teams, designed to bridge the gap between initial site walkthroughs and complex engineering modeling.\n\nThis framework moves beyond merely identifying what equipment is present to understanding how it operates, why it consumes energy at its current rate, and where the thermodynamic inefficiencies lie. We are not just counting units; we are profiling the metabolic rate of the building. This document is structured into distinct \"Data Collection Modules,\" each providing a field-ready checklist template embedded within a deep-dive technical analysis. This structure ensures that every data point collected has a clear engineering purpose, whether it is to calibrate a load simulation, justify a capital expenditure, or identify an immediate low-cost operational improvement. By strictly adhering to these protocols, EverWatt mitigates the risk of modeling errors, reduces the necessity for costly return site visits, and uncovers high-value savings opportunities that surface-level assessments routinely miss.\n\nPart I: Audit Safety, Tools, and Pre-Site Preparation\n\nBefore a single piece of equipment is inspected, the foundational elements of safety, access, and diagnostic capability must be established. An HVAC audit involves interaction with high-voltage electrical systems, high-pressure steam and refrigerant vessels, rotating machinery, and potentially hazardous chemical environments. The auditor’s preparedness directly correlates to the depth and safety of the audit.\n\n1.1 Field Safety Protocols and Risk Assessment\n\nThe safety of the EverWatt team is paramount. HVAC environments are dynamic and often hazardous. Auditors must navigate mechanical rooms that may have been neglected for years, presenting risks ranging from biological hazards in cooling towers to electrical arc flash potential in control panels.\n\nModule 1: Safety & Access Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Item\n\nStatus\n\nGuidance / Action Required / Rationale\n\nPPE Verified\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nMandatory: Hard hat, safety glasses (Z87+), steel-toed boots, ear protection (especially for chiller/boiler rooms >85dB), and cut-resistant gloves. Why: Mechanical rooms contain sharp sheet metal, low overhead clearances, and high noise levels that can cause long-term hearing damage.\n\nLockout/Tagout (LOTO)\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nVerify facility LOTO procedures. Crucial: Never open electrical panels (remove dead fronts) without facility electrician support. Assume all capacitors in VFDs retain lethal charge even after power is cut.\n\nConfined Space\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nIdentify plenums, tanks, crawlspaces, or air handlers large enough to enter. Rule: DO NOT ENTER without certification and facility authorization. Confined spaces can accumulate CO or displace oxygen.1\n\nRoof Access\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nCheck ladder condition, hatch security, and perimeter guarding. Avoid roof edges (<6ft) without fall protection. Context: RTU inspections often require traversing compromised roof membranes.\n\nChemical Hazards\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nNote presence of ammonia (refrigeration), hydrazine (boilers), or biocides (cooling towers). Ensure proper ventilation. Insight: Ammonia leaks are immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).\n\nAsbestos Awareness\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nIn buildings pre-1980, assume pipe insulation (especially on steam lines and boilers) is asbestos. Action: Do not disturb or scrape insulation for identification.\n\nBiological Hazards\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nCheck for standing water in drain pans (Legionella risk) or bird droppings near intakes (Histoplasmosis risk).2\n\nTechnical Rationale: Operational Safety & Liability\n\nThe operational environment of a mechanical plant is unforgiving. For instance, cooling towers are notorious breeding grounds for Legionella pneumophila if water treatment programs fail. An auditor breathing in mist from a poorly maintained tower puts themselves at risk. Similarly, high-pressure steam leaks in boiler rooms can be invisible (\"dry steam\") and capable of cutting through protective clothing instantly. The checklists provided here are not merely bureaucratic hurdles; they are life-safety requirements. Furthermore, understanding the safety status of a facility provides immediate insight into the quality of maintenance. A mechanical room littered with debris, bypassed safety switches, or missing belt guards is a leading indicator of deferred maintenance, suggesting that the HVAC equipment itself is likely operating far below its design efficiency.1\n\n1.2 Essential Diagnostic Tools for the Auditor\n\nTo move beyond a visual inspection (\"The unit is there\") to a diagnostic inspection (\"The unit is failing\"), EverWatt auditors must deploy specific diagnostic tools. The \"eyeball test\" is insufficient for energy engineering. We need quantitative data to build our baselines.\n\nInfrared (Thermal) Camera: This is indispensable for non-contact diagnostics. It allows the auditor to see temperature differentials that indicate failure.\n\nApplication: Detecting insulation voids in the building envelope, identifying overheating electrical breakers (indicating high resistance/loose connections), verifying coil performance (uniform temperature distribution vs. blocked circuits), and spotting steam trap failures (trap is hot on both sides, indicating blow-through).4\n\nCombustion Analyzer: Required for any boiler audit. A blue flame does not guarantee efficiency. We need to measure Oxygen (O2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and net stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency and excess air.6\n\nAnemometer / Manometer: These measure airflow velocity and static pressure. High static pressure drops across filters or coils indicate flow restrictions that exponentially increase fan energy consumption. The manometer is the \"blood pressure cuff\" of the airside system.8\n\nUltrasonic Flow Meter: A non-invasive method to measure fluid flow (GPM) in chilled water or hot water loops without cutting pipes. This verifies if pumps are oversized or if flow is being throttled.\n\nPower Logger / Clamp Meter: For spot-checking instantaneous voltage and amperage of motors to compare against nameplate ratings. This validates the actual load factor of the equipment.\n\nPsychrometer: Measures dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, allowing for the calculation of relative humidity and enthalpy. This is critical for assessing cooling tower performance and economizer operation.\n\nPart II: Facility Operation & Building Envelope Assessment\n\nThe HVAC system does not exist in a vacuum; it is a reactive system designed to counteract the thermal loads imposed by the building envelope and internal processes. Therefore, the audit must begin with a thorough characterization of the building itself. If we do not understand the building's physics and operation, we cannot model the baseline energy usage accurately.\n\n2.1 Facility Operation Profile\n\nThe operational profile defines the \"when\" and \"how much\" of energy consumption. A primary error in energy auditing is assuming standard operating hours (e.g., 9-5) for facilities that may have cleaning crews at night, weekend shifts, or critical loads running 24/7.\n\nModule 2: Facility & Operational Data Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry Requirement\n\nField Guidance & Technical Rationale\n\nFacility Type\n\n☐ Hospital ☐ School ☐ Office ☐ Retail ☐ Industrial ☐ Data Center\n\nRationale: Dictates ventilation codes (ASHRAE 62.1 vs 170) and internal load density. A hospital requires 100% outside air in many zones, driving massive heating/cooling loads compared to an office.10\n\nPrimary Function\n\n____________________\n\nDescribe the activity: e.g., \"Plastic Injection Molding\" vs \"Software Development.\" Why: Manufacturing creates massive internal heat gains; offices are envelope-dominated.\n\nBuilding Size\n\n____________________ sq. ft.\n\nCritical: Used to calculate Energy Use Intensity (EUI = kBtu/sq.ft./yr). If drawings aren't available, pace it out or use Google Earth.\n\nBuilding Age\n\n______ Years\n\nContext: hints at insulation standards (pre-1980 often poor) and glazing technology (single pane vs low-e).\n\nWeekly Operating Hours\n\nWeekday: ____ Weekend: ____\n\nDefine \"Occupied\" vs \"Unoccupied\" setpoints. Why: Critical for baseline energy modeling and scheduling ECMs.\n\nOccupancy Density\n\n______ People/1000sf\n\nEstimate peak vs average. Why: Humans are heat engines (~500 BTU/hr total heat). High density = high cooling load and high ventilation requirement.\n\nProcess Loads\n\n☐ Servers ☐ Medical Imaging ☐ Manufacturing ☐ Kitchens\n\nRationale: These are constant internal heat gains (base loads) unrelated to weather. They must be modeled separately from the HVAC load.10\n\nUtility Rate Structure\n\nElec: $/kWh Demand: $/kW Gas: $___/Therm\n\nFinancial Impact: ECMs that reduce peak demand (kW) are more valuable in high-demand-charge territories.\n\nMaintenance Staff\n\n____________________\n\nName/Contact. Why: Their knowledge of \"buried bodies\" (hidden problems) is invaluable.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Load Profiling and Operational Dynamics\n\nUnderstanding the \"Why\" behind these fields is crucial for the auditor.\n\nLoad Decoupling: We must separate weather-dependent loads (conduction through walls, solar gain) from base loads (lighting, servers, process equipment). A data center operates 8,760 hours a year with a massive cooling load even when it is -20°F outside due to server heat. Conversely, a school operates ~2,000 hours a year and its load is dominated by the need to heat/cool fresh air for students. Confusing these profiles leads to disastrously inaccurate energy models.\n\nScheduling Opportunities: The simplest, highest-ROI ECM is often scheduling. If a building operates 24/7 but only needs strict temperature control from 8 AM to 6 PM, implementing temperature setbacks during unoccupied hours can save 10-20% of HVAC energy immediately without buying new equipment. The auditor must ask: \"Why is this running right now?\".11\n\nUtility Rate Impact: The \"Electric Rate Schedule\" 10 dictates the financial viability of projects. If a client pays high demand charges ($/kW), thermal storage or load-shedding strategies become viable. If they pay flat rates, efficiency (kWh reduction) is the priority.\n\n2.2 Building Envelope Inspection\n\nThe envelope (walls, roof, windows, foundation) acts as the barrier to heat flow. An HVAC system is simply a machine designed to counteract the failure of the envelope to maintain interior conditions. A leaky bucket requires the tap to run constantly; sealing the bucket (the envelope) allows us to turn down the tap (the HVAC).\n\nModule 3: Envelope Integrity Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Point\n\nObservation / Data Entry\n\nWhy This Matters for the Audit\n\nWindow Type\n\n☐ Single ☐ Double ☐ Tinted ☐ Low-E\n\nPhysics: Single pane glass has a U-factor of ~1.0 (R-1). Double pane is ~0.5. This drives conduction load. Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) drives cooling load.\n\nWindow Condition\n\n☐ Sealed ☐ Drafty ☐ Fogged\n\nFogged glass means the seal is broken and the insulating gas (Argon) has escaped.\n\nDoor Seals\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Gaps Visible\n\nVisual Cue: If you can see daylight under a door, air is rushing in. This \"infiltration\" adds latent load (humidity) and sensible load.\n\nWall Insulation\n\n☐ Good ☐ Unknown ☐ Thermal Bridges\n\nUse thermal camera. Look for \"thermal bridging\"—metal studs or beams conducting heat through the wall, bypassing insulation.\n\nRoof Color/Type\n\n☐ Black (EPDM/Tar) ☐ White (TPO/PVC)\n\nCooling Load: A black roof can reach 160°F in summer, conducting massive heat into the building. A white roof stays near ambient, reducing cooling load.12\n\nRoof Insulation\n\n☐ Dry ☐ Wet/Compressed\n\nWet insulation has an R-value of nearly zero. It acts as a conductor. Identifying wet roof sections via thermal imaging is a critical finding.\n\nWall/Floor Joins\n\n☐ Sealed ☐ Drafty\n\nMajor source of infiltration. Air leaks here often bring in unconditioned, humid air, stressing the latent capacity of the AC.\n\nVestibules\n\n☐ Present ☐ Absent\n\nDo main entries have a double-door airlock? If not, wind blows conditioned air right out.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Thermal Dynamics and Infiltration\n\nInfiltration (Air Leakage): Uncontrolled air leakage forces the HVAC system to condition outside air that hasn't passed through a dedicated intake or energy recovery unit. This is the most expensive air to treat because it enters at extreme temperatures. The auditor should look for \"cobwebs moving\" near corners or verify if the building is positively pressurized (doors push open) or negatively pressurized (doors suck shut). Negative pressure sucks in unconditioned air, causing humidity problems and drafts.13\n\nSolar Heat Gain: In commercial buildings with high glass-to-wall ratios, solar gain is often the dominant cooling load. Auditors should note the orientation of glass. West-facing glass causes late-afternoon peak loads that align with peak utility pricing. Tinting or shading these windows is a prime ECM.\n\nInsulation Integrity: It is not enough to know if there is insulation; we must know its condition. Compressed fiberglass loses its R-value. Wet roof insulation not only loses thermal resistance but can destroy the roof deck. The thermal camera is the tool of choice here, revealing cold/hot spots that the naked eye misses.4\n\nPart III: Airside Systems (RTUs, AHUs, and Ductwork)\n\nThe airside system is the mechanism of heat exchange between the central plant (or refrigerant circuit) and the occupied space. It is the \"lungs\" of the building. This section covers Package Rooftop Units (RTUs), Air Handling Units (AHUs), and the distribution ductwork.\n\n3.1 Rooftop Unit (RTU) Audit\n\nRTUs are the ubiquitous workhorses of commercial HVAC, commonly found on retail, light industrial, and office buildings. They are self-contained \"package\" units.\n\nModule 4: RTU Field Data Collection\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nField Guidance / Visual Cues / Technical Note\n\nUnit Tag / ID\n\n____________________\n\nMatch to site plan (e.g., RTU-1, AC-3).\n\nMake / Model\n\n____________________\n\nEssential: Photograph the nameplate. This is the DNA of the unit.\n\nSerial Number\n\n____________________\n\nDecodes the Date of Manufacture. Age Rule: Systems >15 years are nearing end of life and are prime for replacement.15\n\nTonnage / Capacity\n\n____________________ MBH/Tons\n\n12,000 BTU/hr = 1 Ton. Look for numbers divisible by 12 in the model # (e.g., ZP060 = 60k BTU = 5 tons).\n\nCompressor Condition\n\n☐ Running ☐ Short Cycling ☐ Noisy\n\nListen: Does it turn on and off every <5 minutes? This is \"short cycling\" and kills efficiency. Check for oil stains on piping (leaks).\n\nCondenser Coil\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Dirty/Impacted ☐ Fin Damage\n\nLook for \"matting\" (a layer of dirt/cottonwood) or bent fins from hail. Dirty coils raise head pressure, increasing amp draw.\n\nEconomizer Status\n\n☐ Functioning ☐ Stuck Open ☐ Stuck Closed\n\nCritical: Is the damper stuck? Open the hood. Are wires disconnected? Is the linkage rusted? A stuck economizer is a massive energy waster.16\n\nFan Belt Condition\n\n☐ Tight ☐ Loose/Squealing ☐ Worn\n\nPush the belt: >1/2\" deflection = loose. Look for black rubber dust on the guard (slipping belt).\n\nThermostat Settings\n\nSet: ____ Actual: ____ Mode: ____\n\nIs the unit running when the building is unoccupied? Is the fan set to \"On\" (runs 24/7) instead of \"Auto\"?\n\nGas Heat\n\n☐ Present ☐ Electric Heat\n\nIf gas, check flue for soot (bad combustion). If electric, note kW.\n\nTechnical Rationale: RTU Efficiency and Failure Modes\n\nEconomizer Diagnostics: The economizer is a damper system that brings in cool outside air to cool the building without running the compressor (\"free cooling\"). It is the first component to fail and often goes unnoticed.\n\nStuck Open: If stuck open in summer, the unit pulls in 95°F/90% humidity air, overwhelming the coil and causing humidity issues and high energy bills.\n\nStuck Closed: If stuck closed in winter/spring (e.g., 55°F outside), the unit must run mechanical compressors to cool the core of the building, wasting free cooling potential.\n\nAudit Action: The auditor must physically inspect the damper linkage. If it is zip-tied shut or the actuator is hanging loose, mark it as \"Failed\".17\n\nShort Cycling: If a compressor runs for 3 minutes and shuts off, then restarts 2 minutes later, it is \"short cycling.\" This destroys the compressor (due to heat buildup in windings) and ruins efficiency (SEER) because the system never reaches steady-state operation. It indicates oversizing, low refrigerant charge (safety switch tripping), or a blocked coil.19\n\nCondenser Coils: The condenser rejects heat to the outdoors. If the coil is plugged with dirt (\"sweater\"), the refrigerant cannot condense properly. The pressure rises (head pressure), forcing the compressor to work harder and draw more amps. A 10% reduction in airflow can degrade efficiency by 5-10% and capacity by even more.15\n\n3.2 Air Handling Unit (AHU) Deep Dive\n\nAHUs are generally larger, indoor units that may be connected to a central plant (chillers/boilers) or have their own DX (Direct Expansion) cooling. They serve larger zones and have more complex controls.\n\nModule 5: AHU Detailed Inspection Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Technical Note\n\nSupply Fan Type\n\n☐ Centrifugal ☐ Axial ☐ Plenum\n\nNote if VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) is present.\n\nVFD Frequency\n\n______ Hz\n\nGolden Nugget: If the VFD display reads \"60.00 Hz\" constantly, the VFD is bypassed or the controls have failed. It is running at full speed unnecessarily.21\n\nStatic Pressure\n\nSupply: ___\" wc Return: ___\" wc\n\n\"Blood Pressure\": High supply static (>1.5\" wc for typical office) means blocked filters or closed dampers. Low static means a blown duct or broken belt.8\n\nFilter Condition\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Loaded\n\nCheck the Differential Pressure (DP) gauge (e.g., Magnehelic). >0.5\" wc drop usually means replace. High DP kills fan efficiency.22\n\nCooling Coil Valve\n\n☐ Modulating ☐ Hunting\n\nWatch the actuator. Is it constantly moving open/closed? This is \"hunting\" and wastes energy while wearing out the valve.\n\nChilled Water Temp\n\nIn: ___°F Out: ___°F\n\nDelta T: The temperature difference (ΔT) should be ~10-12°F (e.g., 44°F in, 54°F out). Low ΔT (<5°F) indicates \"Low Delta T Syndrome.\"\n\nDuct Leakage\n\n☐ Audible ☐ Visible\n\nListen for hissing. Look for unsealed joints, blown-off tape, or gaps at the unit connection.\n\nO.A. Damper\n\n% Open: ______\n\nMinimum Outside Air (O.A.) should be set for code (e.g., 10-20%). If it's 50% open on a hot day, energy is being wasted.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Airside Dynamics & Static Pressure\n\nStatic Pressure Analysis: Static pressure is the resistance the fan must overcome to move air. It is measured in inches of water column (w.c.).\n\nHigh Static: If the static pressure is high, the fan motor works harder, drawing more amps. Causes include dirty filters, crushed ducts, or fire dampers that have slammed shut.\n\nLow Static: Indicates the fan is spinning but not building pressure—likely a broken belt or a large disconnect in the supply duct.9\n\nLow Delta T Syndrome: In a chilled water system, the water is the transport medium for heat. If water enters the coil at 44°F and leaves at 46°F (ΔT = 2°F), the water is moving too fast through the coil to pick up heat (laminar flow issues or fouled coil). This forces the central plant pumps to pump massive amounts of water to do very little cooling work. It also wreaks havoc on chiller efficiency.24\n\nFilter Pressure Drop: As filters load with dirt, the pressure drop across them increases. In a system with a VFD, the fan speeds up to compensate, using more energy. In a constant volume system, airflow decreases, reducing cooling capacity. Modern \"high efficiency\" filters (MERV 13+) have higher initial pressure drops; the system must be designed to handle this penalty.25\n\nPart IV: Central Plant - Cooling Systems (Chillers & Towers)\n\nCentral plants are the heavy artillery of HVAC. They are the largest energy consumers in large facilities (hospitals, large offices, campuses). Small efficiency gains here yield massive absolute savings.\n\n4.1 Chiller Audit Protocol\n\nA chiller makes cold water. It uses a vapor-compression cycle (or absorption) to remove heat from the water and reject it to the air (air-cooled) or to a cooling tower loop (water-cooled).\n\nModule 6: Chiller Plant Data Log\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nChiller Type\n\n☐ Air Cooled ☐ Water Cooled\n\n☐ Centrifugal ☐ Screw ☐ Scroll ☐ Reciprocating. Why: Centrifugal is efficient at full load; Screw/Scroll better at part load.\n\nRefrigerant Type\n\n____________________\n\nR-134a, R-410a, R-123, R-22 (Phase out). Important for replacement strategy and environmental compliance.26\n\nCapacity\n\n______ Tons\n\nCheck nameplate. 1 Ton = 12,000 BTU/hr.\n\nEntering CHW\n\n______ °F\n\nCHW: Chilled Water. Standard return temp is ~54°F.\n\nLeaving CHW\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard supply temp is ~44°F. A 10°F ΔT is design standard.\n\nEntering CW\n\n______ °F\n\nCW: Condenser Water (for water-cooled). Standard entering from tower is ~85°F (depends on wet bulb).\n\nLeaving CW\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard leaving to tower is ~95°F.\n\nCompressor Amps\n\nL1: __ L2: __ L3: __\n\nCompare to RLA (Rated Load Amps). Imbalance across phases indicates electrical issues.\n\nApproach Temp\n\n______ °F\n\nCritical Efficiency Metric. (Leaving Water Temp - Saturated Refrigerant Temp). See analysis below.\n\nNoise/Vibration\n\n☐ Smooth ☐ Grinding\n\nGrinding indicates bearing failure. High pitched whine might be \"surge\" (aerodynamic stall in centrifugal chillers).\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Sweating\n\nSweating evaporator barrel means insulation failure, gaining heat from the mechanical room.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Chiller Physics & Approach Temperature\n\nThe Approach Temperature is the most vital metric for diagnosing heat exchanger health in a chiller.\n\nEvaporator Approach: The difference between the Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and the Refrigerant Saturation Temperature in the evaporator.\n\nFormula: $T_{approach} = T_{leaving\\_water} - T_{refrigerant}$\n\nTarget: < 2°F to 3°F for modern chillers.\n\nImplication: If the approach is high (e.g., 8°F), it means heat is not transferring well from the water to the refrigerant. This is caused by scale/fouling on the tubes or low refrigerant charge. The compressor must work harder to lower the refrigerant temperature further to achieve the desired water temperature.27\n\nCondenser Approach: The difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and the Saturated Condensing Temperature.\n\nTarget: < 1°F to 4°F.\n\nImplication: High approach here means the chiller cannot get rid of its heat. This is almost always due to dirty tubes (mud/algae/scale from the cooling tower). Every 1°F increase in condenser temperature can increase compressor energy use by ~1.5%.29\n\nLift: The pressure difference between the evaporator and condenser. The compressor's job is to pump against this lift. Lowering the condenser water temperature (via cooling tower optimization) reduces lift and significantly drops energy usage.\n\n4.2 Cooling Tower Inspection\n\nThe cooling tower is the heat rejection device. It relies on evaporation to cool the condenser water. Its performance is tethered to the Wet Bulb Temperature of the ambient air.\n\nModule 7: Cooling Tower Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Visual Cues\n\nDraft Type\n\n☐ Induced ☐ Forced\n\nFan on top pulling air up (Induced) vs Fan on side blowing in (Forced).\n\nFill Condition\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Scaled/Clogged\n\n\"Fill\" is the honeycomb media inside. Scale buildup blocks air/water contact, destroying efficiency. 30\n\nWater Distribution\n\n☐ Uniform ☐ Dry Spots\n\nLook at the nozzles spraying water. Are parts of the fill dry? This reduces cooling capacity.\n\nFan Control\n\n☐ VFD ☐ On/Off ☐ 2-Speed\n\nVFD Opportunity: VFDs on tower fans offer massive savings by allowing the fan speed to float with the load and wet-bulb temperature.\n\nBleed/Blowdown\n\n☐ Auto ☐ Manual\n\nIs water constantly overflowing? Indicates float valve failure. Conductivity meter should control bleed to manage solids.\n\nDrift Eliminators\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Broken/Missing\n\nZig-zag slats that prevent water droplets from escaping. Saves water and chemicals.\n\nStructure\n\n☐ Good ☐ Corroded\n\nCheck for rust on metal towers or rot on wood towers.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Psychrometrics of Heat Rejection\n\nRange: The temperature difference between hot water entering the tower and cold water leaving (Standard ~10°F). $Range = T_{hot\\_in} - T_{cold\\_out}$.\n\nApproach: The difference between the cold water leaving the tower and the ambient Wet Bulb temperature. $Approach = T_{cold\\_out} - T_{wet\\_bulb}$.\n\nRule of Thumb: A tower cannot cool water below the wet bulb temperature. A \"good\" approach is 5°F to 7°F. If the wet bulb is 75°F, the best cold water temp you can theoretically get is ~80-82°F.\n\nAudit Check: If the local Wet Bulb is 70°F and the tower is supplying 85°F water, the approach is 15°F. This indicates poor performance—likely fouled fill, poor airflow, or bad water distribution.31\n\nCycles of Concentration: A measure of water efficiency. It compares the concentration of dissolved solids in the tower water vs. the makeup water. Higher cycles mean less water waste, but require better chemical treatment to prevent scale.\n\nVisual Cue: White scaling on the fill media acts as an insulator and blocks airflow. This forces the tower fan to run at 100% speed to try and maintain setpoint, wasting huge amounts of energy.30\n\nPart V: Central Plant - Heating Systems (Boilers & Steam)\n\nHeating systems are critical for comfort and process (sterilization, cooking), but are often oversized and inefficiently controlled.\n\n5.1 Boiler Audit Data\n\nBoilers come in two main flavors: Steam and Hot Water (Hydronic). Steam is common in older buildings and hospitals; Hot Water is common in modern offices.\n\nModule 8: Boiler System Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nType\n\n☐ Steam ☐ Hot Water\n\n☐ Fire Tube ☐ Water Tube ☐ Condensing ☐ Cast Iron.\n\nFuel Source\n\n☐ Nat. Gas ☐ Propane ☐ Oil\n\n☐ Electric.\n\nInput Capacity\n\n______ MBH\n\n1 Boiler HP ≈ 33,475 BTU/hr. Check nameplate.\n\nCombustion Analysis\n\nO2: __% CO: __ppm\n\nCritical: Must use combustion analyzer. See analysis below.\n\nStack Temp\n\n______ °F\n\nHigh stack temp = heat wasted up the chimney. (Net Stack Temp = Flue Temp - Room Temp).\n\nOperating Pressure/Temp\n\n___ psi / ___ °F\n\nIs it maintaining setpoint? Is the pressure relief valve leaking?\n\nCycles/Hour\n\n______\n\nFrequent on/off (<10 mins) = short cycling. Indicates oversizing or poor control bandwidth.\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Good ☐ Missing/Hot\n\nCheck boiler shell and piping. If you can't touch it (>140°F), it's losing energy to the room.\n\nSteam Traps\n\n☐ Functioning ☐ Blowing\n\nSteam Systems Only: Listen for hissing (blowing through). A failed open trap wastes thousands of dollars a year.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Combustion Efficiency & Stack Physics\n\nBoiler efficiency is determined by how well it burns fuel and transfers that heat to the water.\n\nExcess Air (O2): Combustion requires oxygen. For natural gas, we target ~3% to 5% O2 in the flue gas.\n\nToo High (>10%): We are bringing in too much cold air, heating it up, and sending it out the stack. This is a major efficiency loss.\n\nToo Low (<2%): Dangerous. Incomplete combustion occurs, creating Carbon Monoxide (CO) and soot (unburned fuel). This is a safety hazard.32\n\nStack Temperature: The flue gas must be hot enough to create draft and prevent condensation (unless it's a condensing boiler), but not too hot.\n\nRule of Thumb: Stack temp should be ~ambient + 300°F for standard boilers. If stack temp is 500°F+, the boiler tubes are likely sooted (fouled) on the fire side or scaled on the water side, insulating the water from the heat.33\n\nCondensing Boilers: These high-efficiency units (90%+) are designed to extract latent heat from water vapor in the flue gas. To do this, they must have low return water temperatures (<130°F) to cause condensation.\n\nAudit Check: If a facility has expensive condensing boilers but runs a standard 180°F supply / 160°F return loop, the boilers will not condense. They are operating at standard efficiency (80-82%), wasting the investment. This is a very common design/operation failure.34\n\n5.2 Domestic Hot Water (DHW)\n\nModule 9: DHW Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance\n\nSystem Type\n\n☐ Storage ☐ Tankless\n\n☐ Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH).\n\nTemp Setting\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard is 120°F (140°F for kitchens/hospitals). >140°F is scald hazard and energy waste.\n\nRecirculation Pump\n\n☐ Timer ☐ 24/7\n\n24/7 recirculation keeps pipes hot but wastes heat loss through the loop. A timer or aquastat is a simple ECM.\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Pipe ☐ Tank\n\nFirst 5ft of pipe from tank must be insulated (heat trap). Tank wrap needed for older units.\n\nPart VI: Hydronics & Distribution (Pumps, Pipes, Valves)\n\nMoving energy (water/air) uses energy. Inefficient pumping can account for 20-30% of HVAC usage. We must assess if the pumps are fighting the system or working with it.\n\n6.1 Pump Audit\n\nModule 10: Pump Station Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nApplication\n\n☐ CHW ☐ HW ☐ CW\n\nChilled, Hot, or Condenser Water.\n\nControl\n\n☐ VFD ☐ Constant Speed\n\nCheck if VFD is present but manually bypassed (running 60Hz).\n\nPressure Gauges\n\nSuction: __ Discharge: __\n\nCritical: Calculate Pump Head ($Head = (Discharge\\_psi - Suction\\_psi) \\times 2.31$). This validates the pump curve.\n\nValves (Triple Duty)\n\n☐ 100% Open ☐ Throttled\n\nMajor Waste: If the discharge valve is 50% closed (\"throttled\") to balance flow, it is like driving with the parking brake on. We are burning energy to overcome artificial resistance. Solution: Trim impeller or use VFD.\n\nNoise\n\n☐ Silent ☐ Gravel/Rocks\n\n\"Pumping rocks\" sound = Cavitation.\n\nSeal Condition\n\n☐ Dry ☐ Leaking\n\nWater on floor under coupler? Indicates mechanical seal failure.\n\nMotor\n\n______ HP / ______ RPM\n\nRecord nameplate data.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Pumping Dynamics & Cavitation\n\nCavitation: This occurs when pressure at the suction eye of the impeller falls below the water's vapor pressure. The water essentially \"boils\" at room temperature, creating vapor bubbles. When these bubbles move to the high-pressure discharge side, they implode violently.\n\nConsequences: Destroys impellers (pitting), destroys seals, creates noise, and reduces flow.\n\nVisual/Audio Cue: Sounds like marbles or gravel rattling in the pipe. Often caused by clogged suction strainers or poor system design (Net Positive Suction Head issue).35\n\nDeadhead Pressure: The pressure when the pump runs against a closed valve (zero flow). Measuring this and comparing it to the manufacturer's pump curve verifies if the impeller is worn or has been trimmed.\n\nThrottling: Using a valve to reduce flow consumes near-full pump energy while doing less work. This is a prime candidate for a VFD retrofit. The VFD allows you to open the valve and slow the pump down, saving energy according to the Affinity Laws (Power varies with the cube of speed).37\n\nPart VII: Building Automation & Controls (BMS)\n\nThe Building Management System (BMS) or Energy Management System (EMS) is the \"brain\" of the HVAC system. A confused brain wastes energy, no matter how efficient the \"muscles\" (equipment) are.\n\nModule 11: BMS / Controls Audit Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Item\n\nObservation\n\nTechnical Guidance / \"The Why\"\n\nInterface\n\n☐ Modern GUI ☐ Legacy Text\n\nOlder systems may lack optimization logic (reset schedules, optimal start).\n\nOverrides\n\n______ % of points\n\nLook for \"Hand\" symbols, \"Operator\" priority, or forced values. Rule: If >10-20% of valves/fans are overridden \"Open,\" the auto-logic has failed. The system is manual.\n\nSchedules\n\n☐ Aligned ☐ 24/7\n\nDo schedules match actual occupancy? Check for \"temporary\" overrides left for years (e.g., \"Party Mode\" from 2019).\n\nSensor Calibration\n\n☐ Realistic ☐ Error\n\nE.g., Outside Air Temp reading 120°F in winter or 0°F in summer. Failed sensors cause economizers and reset schedules to malfunction completely.38\n\nSetpoints\n\nCool: __ Heat: __\n\nDeadband: Are heating/cooling setpoints too close (e.g., Heat to 70, Cool to 71)? This causes simultaneous heating and cooling (fighting), a massive waste. Target >4°F deadband.\n\nReset Schedules\n\n☐ Active ☐ Static\n\nDoes the hot water temp drop when it's warm outside? Does static pressure drop when VAVs close? Static setpoints waste energy.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Control Logic Failures\n\nSimultaneous Heating & Cooling: A classic waste found in VAV systems. One VAV box enters heating mode (reheat coil on), raising the return air temp. The central AHU sees this warm return air and ramps up cooling to compensate. The boiler and chiller effectively fight each other, and the utility meter spins.\n\nSensor Drift: Sensors drift over time. A CO2 sensor reading 2000ppm (when actual is 400ppm) will force outside air dampers open to 100%, causing huge heating/cooling loads. An outdoor air sensor reading 50°F when it is really 80°F will open the economizer, flooding the building with humid heat.\n\nOptimized Start/Stop: Does the system start at 6 AM fixed? Or does it calculate start time based on indoor/outdoor temp? \"Optimized Start\" can save hundreds of hours of run time per year.\n\nPart VIII: Specialized Environments (Server Rooms & Labs)\n\nThese areas have high energy density and critical requirements. They often override standard building controls.\n\nModule 12: Mission Critical Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance\n\nTemp Setpoint\n\n______ °F\n\nServers are often okay at 75-80°F (ASHRAE TC 9.9 guidelines). Many legacy server rooms cool to 65°F unnecessarily. Raising setpoints saves cooling energy.\n\nCRAC Units\n\n☐ Downflow ☐ Upflow\n\nComputer Room Air Conditioners. Check floor tiles.\n\nAirflow Management\n\n☐ Hot/Cold Aisle ☐ Chaotic\n\nAre perforated tiles located only in cold aisles (front of servers)? Are there blanks in the racks?\n\nCable Management\n\n☐ Tidy ☐ Blocked\n\nCables blocking rear rack exhaust cause hot spots, forcing server fans to run at 100% RPM.39\n\nRedundancy\n\nN+1 present?\n\nEnsure backup cooling doesn't mean running all units at 100% capacity simultaneously. They should stage or run at part-load.\n\nPart IX: Advanced Diagnostics & IoT Integration\n\nModern auditing can be augmented by the temporary installation of IoT sensors to capture data over time (1-2 weeks), rather than just a snapshot.\n\n9.1 IoT Data Logging Strategy\n\nCurrent Transducers (CTs): Clip onto motor leads to log amperage. This reveals the load profile. Is the motor running 24/7? Is it variable or constant?.40\n\nTemp/Humidity Loggers: Place in spaces to verify thermostat accuracy and comfort. Place in supply/return ducts to verify ΔT and economizer operation over a week.\n\nVibration Sensors: Magnetic sensors on pumps/motors. increasing vibration trends predict bearing failure or cavitation before it becomes audible.41\n\n9.2 Field Rules of Thumb for Auditors\n\nUse these to sanity-check your findings in real-time.\n\nCooling Load: ~400-500 sq. ft. per Ton for average offices. If a 2,000 sq. ft. office has a 10-ton unit (200 sq. ft./ton), it is grossly oversized.42\n\nAirflow: ~400 CFM per Ton of cooling.\n\nChiller Flow: ~2.4 GPM per Ton for Chilled Water; ~3.0 GPM per Ton for Condenser Water.42\n\nMotor Amps: Full load amps (FLA) roughly equals Horsepower × 1.2 (for 460V 3-phase). If a 10HP motor is drawing 2 amps, it's doing no work (broken belt/coupling).\n\n9.3 Visual Deficiencies Guide\n\nSoot on Boiler Vent: Incomplete combustion / lack of air / clogged burner.\n\nIce on DX Coil: Low airflow, dirty filter, or low refrigerant charge.\n\nOil Stains on Piping: Refrigerant leak location.\n\nDimming Lights on Start-up: Compressor \"Hard Start\"—electrical issues, bad capacitor, or locked rotor.43\n\nPart X: Post-Audit Analysis & Reporting\n\nThe value of the audit is in the translation of field data into actionable ECMs. The data collected in Modules 1-12 feeds directly into the engineering calculations.\n\nModule 13: Analysis Preparation\n\nData Point Collected\n\nECM Opportunity\n\nCalculation Methodology\n\nStuck Economizer\n\nAirside Economizer Repair\n\nBin analysis using local weather data to calculate hours of free cooling lost.\n\nConstant Volume Fan\n\nVFD Retrofit\n\nFan Laws: Power varies with the cube of speed ($P_2 = P_1 \\times (N_2/N_1)^3$). 20% speed reduction = 50% energy savings.\n\nHigh Discharge Pressure\n\nPump Impeller Trimming\n\nPump Laws. Analyze pump curve vs system curve to find new operating point.\n\nLighting Schedule\n\nBMS Scheduling\n\nSimple runtime reduction (kW × hours saved).\n\nLow Delta T\n\nCoil Cleaning / Valve Repair\n\nIncreases chiller efficiency and reduces pump energy.\n\n10.1 Required Documentation for Engineering Handoff\n\nTo close the audit loop, ensure the following are collected before leaving the site:\n\n[ ] 12-36 months of utility bills (Electric, Gas, Water).10\n\n[ ] Mechanical schedules (As-built drawings) - scan or photo.\n\n[ ] TAB (Test, Adjust, Balance) reports (provides design airflow baselines).\n\n[ ] Photos of every nameplate and every visual deficiency (macro and wide shots).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis framework provides EverWatt with a structured, rigorous methodology for conducting HVAC audits.

Executive Architecture: Unifying Building Science and Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n\nThe development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model capable of accurately predicting Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) loads and quantifying energy efficiency potential requires a fundamental departure from purely stochastic approaches. While generic machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in large datasets, they lack the physical grounding necessary to distinguish between operational anomalies and structural inefficiencies in the built environment. To create a model that is both predictive and prescriptive—capable of not just forecasting energy use but also recommending engineered interventions—the architecture must be built upon the rigid pillars of industry-standard protocols and empirical building physics.\n\nThis comprehensive report establishes the technical requirements for such a model. It aggregates and synthesizes the definitive methodologies from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), and the Investor Confidence Project (ICP). Furthermore, it integrates empirical load distribution data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and the California Commercial End-Use Survey (CEUS) to provide the necessary training priors for the model.\n\nThe proposed AI architecture operates on a hierarchical logic system. At its base, ASHRAE Guideline 14 provides the statistical validity tests (NMBE, CV-RMSE) that determine if a baseline model is sufficiently accurate to measure savings against. Above this, ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G provides the benchmarking logic, allowing the AI to compare a specific building's performance against a \"Standard Reference Design\" (SRD) defined by code. Concurrently, the ICP Protocols dictate the data sufficiency requirements, ensuring that the model’s outputs satisfy the rigor demanded by financial underwriting. Finally, the Physics Layer imposes thermodynamic constraints—specifically psychrometric equations and fan affinity laws—to prevent the model from generating physically impossible predictions.\n\nBy encoding these standards directly into the model's loss functions and decision trees, the resulting system serves as an automated energy engineer, capable of performing Level 1 and Level 2 audits at scale with verifiable accuracy.\n\n\n\n2. Statistical Core: Inverse Modeling Standards (ASHRAE Guideline 14)\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the AI model in an energy efficiency context is to establish a counterfactual baseline: a mathematical representation of how a facility would have performed under specific conditions had no energy conservation measures (ECMs) been implemented. This process, known as inverse modeling, is strictly governed by ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014, which defines the statistical thresholds for model validity.\n\n\n\n2.1 The Mathematics of Model Calibration\n\n\n\nFor an AI model to be accepted as a valid tool for Measurement and Verification (M&V), it must demonstrate that its predictions match historical meter data within specific error bands. ASHRAE Guideline 14 establishes two primary goodness-of-fit metrics that the AI's training algorithms must optimize: the Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE) and the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE).\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE)\n\n\n\nThe NMBE is a measure of the total systematic error (bias) in the model. In the context of AI training, NMBE acts as a constraint on the overall integration of the energy curve. A model with low NMBE ensures that the total predicted energy over a year matches the total measured energy, even if individual hourly predictions fluctuate. This is critical for financial modeling, where the total cost savings are the primary metric.\n\nThe governing equation for NMBE, as defined by ASHRAE Guideline 14, is:\n\n\n\n$$\\text{NMBE} = \\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=1} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)}{(n - p) \\times \\bar{y}} \\times 100$$\n\nWhere:\n\n$y_i$ represents the measured dependent variable (e.g., actual kWh consumption) at interval $i$.\n\n$\\hat{y}_i$ represents the predicted dependent variable (model output) at interval $i$.\n\n$\\bar{y}$ is the arithmetic mean of the observed dependent variable values ($y$).\n\n$n$ is the total number of data points in the training set.\n\n$p$ is the number of parameters in the regression model (degrees of freedom).\n\nImplications for AI Logic:\n\nThe formula explicitly penalizes bias by summing the residuals $(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)$. If the errors are randomly distributed around zero (unbiased), the sum tends toward zero, resulting in a low NMBE. If the model consistently overpredicts or underpredicts, NMBE grows.\n\nThresholds: To be compliant with ASHRAE Guideline 14, the AI model must achieve an NMBE of ±5% when calibrated to monthly utility billing data, or ±10% when calibrated to hourly interval data.1\n\nOptimization Strategy: The AI's loss function must include a regularization term that heavily penalizes non-zero summation of residuals, ensuring that the integral of the prediction matches the integral of the history.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE)\n\n\n\nWhile NMBE measures bias, CV-RMSE measures precision—the scatter of the data points around the regression line. It represents the model's ability to capture the dynamic response of the building to changing independent variables like weather or occupancy.\n\nThe governing equation for CV-RMSE is:\n\n\n\n$$\\text{CV(RMSE)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=1} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{n - p}}}{\\bar{y}} \\times 100$$\n\nImplications for AI Logic:\n\nThe numerator essentially calculates the standard deviation of the residuals. A high CV-RMSE indicates that the model is failing to explain the variance in the energy data. This typically signals that a critical independent variable (driver) is missing from the AI's input features.\n\nThresholds: ASHRAE Guideline 14 requires a CV-RMSE of less than 15% for monthly data and less than 30% for hourly data.2\n\nFeature Engineering Trigger: If the AI trains a model using only Outside Air Temperature (OAT) and the resulting CV-RMSE exceeds 30%, the system logic must trigger a search for additional variables. Common missing drivers include Occupancy Schedules (time-of-day binary variables), Production Rates (for industrial facilities), or Humidity (enthalpy effects). The gap between the 15% monthly allowance and the 30% hourly allowance acknowledges the inherent noise in high-frequency data, such as the random behavior of occupants or short-term thermal mass effects.3\n\n\n\n2.2 Regression Methodologies and Change-Point Detection\n\n\n\nASHRAE Guideline 14 identifies specific regression structures that best approximate building thermal performance. The AI model should not blindly apply deep learning techniques (like LSTMs) without first establishing a baseline using these interpretable physical regression models.\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Change-Point Models (3P, 4P, 5P)\n\n\n\nBuilding energy use is rarely linear across the entire temperature spectrum. It typically exhibits distinct regimes: a \"deadband\" where energy use is driven by baseloads (lighting, plug loads) and not weather, and \"heating/cooling slopes\" where energy use increases linearly with temperature deviation. The AI must be capable of fitting Change-Point Models.4\n\nThree-Parameter (3P) Model: Appropriate for buildings with only heating or only cooling dependency.\n\nEquation: $E = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2(T - \\beta_3)^+$\n\n$\\beta_1$: Baseload energy consumption.\n\n$\\beta_2$: Slope of the weather-dependent curve (UA value proxy).\n\n$\\beta_3$: Change-point temperature (balance point).\n\nFour-Parameter (4P) Model: Used when there is a distinct heating slope and a distinct cooling slope, but they meet at a single change point (common in heat pump applications).\n\nFive-Parameter (5P) Model: The most robust model for commercial buildings with simultaneous heating and cooling capabilities. It defines a deadband between two distinct change points.\n\nEquation: $E = C + B_1(\\beta_{heat} - T)^+ + B_2(T - \\beta_{cool})^+$\n\nThis model captures the behavior of VAV systems with reheat, where energy use is high in winter, drops in the swing season deadband, and rises again in summer.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Non-Routine Adjustments (NRA) and Categorical Variables\n\n\n\nA major challenge in energy modeling is the \"Non-Routine Event\" (NRE)—a structural change in the facility that renders the baseline invalid. Examples include the addition of a new wing, a change in shift schedules (e.g., going from 1 shift to 2 shifts), or significant occupancy changes (e.g., COVID-19).\n\nASHRAE Guideline 14 and the IPMVP protocols mandate Non-Routine Adjustments (NRA) using categorical (dummy) variables. The AI model must detect these shifts and adjust the regression equation accordingly.\n\nMethodology:\n\nThe regression equation is expanded to include binary indicator variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$E = C + B_1 V_1 + B_2 V_2 + \\dots + D_1 I_{event}$$\n\nWhere:\n\n$I_{event}$ is a binary variable (0 for the pre-event period, 1 for the post-event period).\n\n$D_1$ represents the fixed shift in energy consumption (intercept shift) attributable to the event.\n\nAI Detection Logic:\n\nThe AI should continuously monitor the Cumulative Sum of Residuals (CUSUM). If the CUSUM graph deviates significantly from zero (a \"knee\" in the curve), it indicates a permanent shift in the system. The AI then introduces a dummy variable at the timestamp of the deviation. If re-running the regression with this dummy variable significantly reduces the CV-RMSE (improving the fit), the event is confirmed as a valid NRE, and the coefficient $D_1$ quantifies the energy impact of that change (e.g., \"The new server room added 50 kW to the baseload\").5\n\n\n\n3. Verification Frameworks: IPMVP Protocols\n\n\n\nWhile ASHRAE Guideline 14 provides the mathematical engine, the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) provides the contractual framework. The AI model must categorize its analysis into one of the four IPMVP Options to ensure that the reported savings are compliant with performance contracts and utility rebate requirements.\n\n\n\n3.1 Option C: Whole Facility Verification\n\n\n\nThis is the primary mode for an AI model ingesting utility bill data.\n\nMethodology: Regression analysis of whole-building meter data against independent variables (weather, occupancy).\n\nThreshold for Applicability: Option C is generally recommended only when the expected savings exceed 10% of the total facility energy use. If savings are smaller, they may be lost in the statistical noise (uncertainty) of the regression.\n\nAI Implementation: The model calculates the \"Avoided Energy Use\":$$ \\text{Savings} = \\text{Energy}{\\text{Baseline Model}}(\\text{Current Conditions}) - \\text{Energy}{\\text{Measured}} $$The AI must generate a baseline model using historical data (Training Period) and then project that model into the reporting period using current weather data.7\n\n\n\n3.2 Option D: Calibrated Simulation\n\n\n\nThis option is necessary when no historical baseline exists (e.g., new construction or major renovation) or when isolating a specific retrofit is impossible via metering.\n\nMethodology: The AI creates a physics-based simulation (Digital Twin) using engines like EnergyPlus or DOE-2.\n\nCalibration: The simulation inputs (schedules, U-values, efficiencies) are iteratively adjusted until the simulation's output matches the actual utility bills.\n\nAI Implementation: This requires an optimization loop (e.g., genetic algorithms) where the AI tweaks thousands of parameters to minimize the CV-RMSE between the simulation and the meter. Once calibrated, the AI can simulate \"What-If\" scenarios—removing specific ECMs to calculate savings.8\n\n\n\n3.3 Option A & B: Retrofit Isolation\n\n\n\nThese options focus on specific pieces of equipment rather than the whole building.\n\nOption A (Key Parameter Measurement): Measures only the critical parameter (e.g., lighting operating hours) and estimates the others (e.g., fixture wattage).\n\nOption B (All Parameter Measurement): Measures all parameters (e.g., continuous metering of a VFD's power draw).\n\nAI Implementation: The AI focuses on subsystem modeling. For a chiller retrofit, it would model the $kW/ton$ vs. $Load$ curve. The baseline is the pre-retrofit efficiency curve; savings are the difference between the pre-retrofit curve applied to the current load and the actual measured power.11\n\n\n\n4. Project Standardization: Investor Confidence Project (ICP) Protocols\n\n\n\nTo bridge the gap between engineering calculations and financial underwriting, the AI model must adhere to the Investor Confidence Project (ICP) protocols. These protocols standardize the data requirements and documentation to reduce risk for investors.\n\n\n\n4.1 ICP Baselining Requirements\n\n\n\nICP mandates strict data sufficiency standards to ensure that baselines are robust. The AI model should implement a \"Data Quality Gate\" that rejects or flags datasets that do not meet these criteria.\n\nTier 1 vs. Tier 2 Requirements:\n\nData Duration: A minimum of 12 months of contiguous energy data is required. ICP recommends 36 months to capture year-on-year weather variability and anomalies.\n\nCoverage: The data must account for 100% of the energy sources for the building or the isolated system being retrofitted. The AI must check for gaps or missing fuel types (e.g., gas data present but electric missing).13\n\nIndependent Variables: The AI must ingest corresponding weather data (Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days) for the exact same interval as the energy data. It must also normalize for occupancy vacancy rates if they fluctuate.\n\nAlgorithm Validation: The model must verify that the regression statistics meet the ASHRAE G14 thresholds ($R^2 > 0.75$, CV-RMSE < 20% for baseline) before proceeding to savings calculation.13\n\n\n\n4.2 Standard Industry Practice (SIP) Baseline\n\n\n\nFor projects where a historical baseline is not appropriate (e.g., replacing a broken boiler at end-of-life), ICP and ASHRAE 90.1 mandate the use of a \"Standard Industry Practice\" (SIP) baseline.\n\nConcept: Savings are not calculated against the old broken boiler, but against a new standard-efficiency boiler that represents the market standard.\n\nAI Logic: The AI must distinguish between \"Early Replacement\" (savings vs. existing efficiency) and \"Burnout/End-of-Life\" (savings vs. code minimum efficiency). If the equipment age exceeds its useful life (e.g., >20 years for a boiler), the AI should default to the SIP baseline to avoid overstating savings.13\n\n\n\n5. Benchmarking and Reference Designs: ASHRAE Standard 90.1\n\n\n\nTo assess \"Potential for Energy Efficiency,\" the AI must compare the building's current performance against a theoretical ideal. ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G provides the rules for creating this \"Standard Reference Design\" (SRD).\n\n\n\n5.1 Baseline System Mapping (Appendix G)\n\n\n\nOne of the most complex heuristic tasks for the AI is determining the correct baseline HVAC system type. Appendix G Table G3.1.1-3 provides the mapping logic based on building type, size, and heating source.\n\nTable 1: ASHRAE 90.1 Baseline HVAC System Mapping Logic 14\n\nBuilding Type\n\nNumber of Floors\n\nGross Floor Area (ft²)\n\nHeating Source\n\nBaseline System Type\n\nDescription\n\nResidential\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nElectric\n\nSystem 2\n\nPTHP (Packaged Terminal Heat Pump)\n\nResidential\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nFossil Fuel\n\nSystem 1\n\nPTAC (Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner)\n\nPublic Assembly\n\nAny\n\n< 120,000\n\nAny\n\nSystem 3 / 4\n\nPSZ-AC / PSZ-HP (Single Zone)\n\nPublic Assembly\n\nAny\n\n> 120,000\n\nAny\n\nSystem 12 / 13\n\nSZ-CV (Single Zone Constant Volume)\n\nNon-Residential\n\n< 3\n\n< 25,000\n\nAny\n\nSystem 3 / 4\n\nPSZ-AC / PSZ-HP\n\nNon-Residential\n\n4-5\n\n< 25,000\n\nAny\n\nSystem 5 / 6\n\nPackaged VAV (Reheat / PFP)\n\nNon-Residential\n\nAny\n\n25,000 - 150,000\n\nFossil Fuel\n\nSystem 5\n\nPackaged VAV with Reheat\n\nNon-Residential\n\nAny\n\n25,000 - 150,000\n\nElectric\n\nSystem 6\n\nPackaged VAV with PFP Boxes\n\nNon-Residential\n\n> 5\n\n> 150,000\n\nFossil Fuel\n\nSystem 7\n\nVAV with Reheat (Chilled Water)\n\nNon-Residential\n\n> 5\n\n> 150,000\n\nElectric\n\nSystem 8\n\nVAV with PFP Boxes (Chilled Water)\n\nHeated Only\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nSystem 9 / 10\n\nHeating and Ventilation\n\nAI Insight: The transition from System 3/4 (Constant Volume) to System 5/7 (Variable Air Volume) represents a massive efficiency leap. If the AI detects a 100,000 ft² office building (which maps to System 5) but the load shape suggests Constant Volume operation (System 3), it identifies a high-priority retrofit opportunity (VAV Conversion).\n\n\n\n5.2 Economizer High-Limit Control Logic\n\n\n\nFaulty economizers are a leading cause of energy waste. The AI must enforce the high-limit shutoff logic defined in ASHRAE 90.1 Table 6.5.1.1.3 to diagnose performance. The logic varies by Climate Zone, balancing the benefit of free cooling against the penalty of introducing humidity.\n\nTable 2: ASHRAE 90.1 Economizer High-Limit Shutoff Settings 15\n\nControl Type\n\nAllowed Climate Zones\n\nShutoff Setpoint (Economizer OFF when...)\n\nFixed Dry Bulb\n\n5A, 6A, 7, 8\n\n$T_{OA} > 70^\\circ\\text{F}$\n\nFixed Dry Bulb\n\n3B, 3C, 4B, 4C, 5B, 5C, 6B\n\n$T_{OA} > 75^\\circ\\text{F}$\n\nFixed Dry Bulb\n\n0B, 1B, 2B, 3A, 4A\n\n$T_{OA} > 65^\\circ\\text{F}$\n\nDifferential Dry Bulb\n\n0B, 1B, 2B, 3B, 3C, 4B, 4C, 5A-6B\n\n$T_{OA} > T_{RA}$\n\nFixed Enthalpy\n\nAll\n\n$h_{OA} > 28 \\text{ Btu/lb}$ OR $T_{OA} > 75^\\circ\\text{F}$\n\nDifferential Enthalpy\n\nAll\n\n$h_{OA} > h_{RA}$ OR $T_{OA} > 75^\\circ\\text{F}$\n\nAI Logic: The model must ingest local weather data. For every hour where the facility requires cooling, the AI checks if the economizer should be active based on the Climate Zone rules above. If the meter data shows a high cooling load during these \"free cooling\" hours, the AI flags an \"Economizer Fault\" or \"Failed Damper.\" Note that Differential Enthalpy provides the highest theoretical efficiency but relies on humidity sensors that are prone to drift; the AI should prioritize Differential Dry Bulb diagnostics for robustness in drier climates.17\n\n\n\n5.3 Equipment Efficiency Standards\n\n\n\nThe AI must benchmark specific equipment performance against ASHRAE 90.1 Table 6.8.1 standards.\n\nChillers: Efficiency requirements are split into Path A (Full Load optimized) and Path B (Part Load/IPLV optimized). Path B is generally preferred for VFD-driven chillers in variable load buildings.\n\nExample Check: If a water-cooled centrifugal chiller (<300 tons) has an efficiency of 0.65 kW/ton, the AI compares this to the Path A standard (approx 0.61 kW/ton) and calculates the penalty.19\n\nBoilers: Efficiency is measured in Thermal Efficiency ($E_t$) or Combustion Efficiency ($E_c$). Gas boilers > 2,500,000 Btu/h typically require $E_c \\ge 80\\%$ or $E_c \\ge 82\\%$ depending on vintage.20\n\n\n\n6. Thermodynamic Constraints: Physics-Informed AI\n\n\n\nTo prevent \"hallucinations\" where the AI predicts physically impossible energy savings, the model must incorporate fundamental thermodynamic laws as hard constraints.\n\n\n\n6.1 Psychrometrics: The Energy of Air\n\n\n\nHVAC systems manage not just temperature (Sensible Heat) but also moisture (Latent Heat). The AI must calculate Enthalpy ($h$) to accurately model cooling coil loads.\n\nGoverning Equations:\n\nTotal Heat Equation:$$\\Delta Q_{total} = 4.5 \\times \\text{CFM} \\times \\Delta h$$Where 4.5 is a derived constant ($60 \\text{ min/hr} \\times 0.075 \\text{ lb/ft}^3 \\text{ density}$).\n\nSensible Heat Equation:$$\\Delta Q_{sensible} = 1.08 \\times \\text{CFM} \\times \\Delta T$$Where 1.08 is derived from ($4.5 \\times 0.24 \\text{ Btu/lb}^\\circ\\text{F}$ specific heat).\n\nLatent Heat Equation:$$\\Delta Q_{latent} = 4840 \\times \\text{CFM} \\times \\Delta W$$Where $\\Delta W$ is the change in humidity ratio ($lb_{H2O}/lb_{DA}$).21\n\nAI Application:\n\nThe AI calculates the \"Sensible Heat Ratio\" (SHR) = $Q_{sensible} / Q_{total}$. If the AI predicts high cooling energy in a dry climate (High SHR) vs a humid climate (Low SHR), it must validate that the latent load component ($\\Delta W$) aligns with the weather file's dew point data. This prevents the model from underestimating cooling loads in humid zones like 1A (Miami).22\n\n\n\n6.2 Fan and Pump Affinity Laws\n\n\n\nThe most significant potential for energy efficiency usually lies in converting Constant Volume (CV) systems to Variable Volume (VAV) using Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs). The savings are non-linear, governed by the Affinity Laws.\n\nThe Cubic Law of Power:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\right)^3$$\n\n\n\nWhere $P$ is Power and $N$ is Speed.\n\nAI Application:\n\nImplication: A reduction in fan speed to 80% results in a power drop to roughly 51% ($0.8^3 = 0.512$).\n\nDiagnostic Logic: The AI analyzes the load profile. If the fan power is constant while the cooling load varies, the system is likely utilizing discharge dampers or bypass valves (inefficient). The AI simulates the installation of a VFD by calculating the required flow ratio ($Q_{req}/Q_{design}$) for each hour and applying the cubic law to estimate the VFD power. The difference is the \"Technical Potential Savings\".23\n\n\n\n7. Empirical Data Foundations: CBECS and CEUS\n\n\n\nWhile physics provides the equations, empirical surveys provide the coefficients. The AI model relies on data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and the California Commercial End-Use Survey (CEUS) to set reliable priors for Energy Use Intensity (EUI) and end-use disaggregation.\n\n\n\n7.1 CBECS 2018: National Benchmarks\n\n\n\nCBECS provides the \"Average\" performance against which a building is judged. The AI uses this to calculate the \"EUI Gap\"—the difference between the subject building and the median peer.\n\nTable 3: CBECS 2018 Major Fuel Consumption Intensities by End Use (kBtu/ft²) 25\n\nPrincipal Activity\n\nTotal EUI\n\nHeating\n\nCooling\n\nVentilation\n\nLighting\n\nComputing\n\nRefrigeration\n\nOffice\n\n65.6\n\n20.1\n\n5.1\n\n12.9\n\n7.8\n\n5.2\n\n2.6\n\nEducation\n\n62.7\n\n27.6\n\n7.3\n\n4.8\n\n5.5\n\n2.4\n\n3.3\n\nHealth Care (Inpatient)\n\n193.3\n\n62.6\n\n13.8\n\n28.6\n\n11.9\n\n7.2\n\n18.8\n\nRetail (Mercantile)\n\n88.4\n\n22.8\n\n6.7\n\n10.8\n\n13.1\n\n2.0\n\n16.8\n\nFood Service\n\n263.3\n\n35.6\n\n19.1\n\n16.6\n\n10.8\n\n0.9\n\n109.7\n\nWarehouse\n\n26.8\n\n11.8\n\n1.7\n\n1.2\n\n5.8\n\n0.4\n\n4.4\n\nLodging\n\n85.7\n\n15.7\n\n6.0\n\n12.5\n\n7.2\n\n1.2\n\n14.1\n\nCritical AI Insights from CBECS Data:\n\nVentilation vs. Cooling: In Office buildings, Ventilation energy (12.9) is more than double the Cooling energy (5.1). This instructs the AI to prioritize \"Airside Optimization\" strategies (Static Pressure Reset, VAV Box turndown) over \"Plant Side Optimization\" (Chiller replacement) for office asset classes.\n\nProcess Load dominance in Food Service: The Refrigeration load (109.7) in Food Service dwarfs Heating and Cooling combined. The AI must isolate this process load (which is flat/constant) from the HVAC load (which is weather-dependent) during the regression phase, or it will misinterpret the building's thermal sensitivity.25\n\n\n\n7.2 CEUS: Granular Load Shapes and Equipment Capacity\n\n\n\nThe California Commercial End-Use Survey (CEUS) provides finer granularity on how loads are distributed over time and equipment sizing.\n\nHVAC Load Ratios (CEUS):\n\nMiscellaneous Buildings: HVAC can account for 40-50% of total electric load.26\n\nRTU Sizing: CEUS data reveals significant oversizing in Rooftop Units (RTUs). The capacity distribution shows that a high percentage of small commercial buildings have RTUs in the 3-5 ton range, often aggregated to meet total load.\n\nAI Logic: When modeling small commercial sites (<25k ft²), the AI should assume multiple discrete change-points (staging) rather than a single smooth VAV curve, reflecting the cycling nature of multiple packaged units.27\n\nLoad Shape Profiles:\n\nCEUS provides hourly fractional load profiles (0.0 to 1.0) for different building types. The AI can use these to disaggregate monthly billing data.\n\nAlgorithm: Hourly_Estimate = Monthly_Bill * (CEUS_Hourly_Fraction / Sum_CEUS_Monthly_Fractions)\n\nThis allows the AI to perform \"Virtual Interval Metering\" for buildings that only have monthly data, enabling the simulation of Time-of-Use (TOU) rate impacts and peak demand savings.26\n\n\n\n8. Energy Audit Integration: ASHRAE Level 1, 2, and 3\n\n\n\nThe AI model effectively acts as an automated auditor. It is crucial to understand the hierarchy of audit rigor defined by ASHRAE to align the model's output with industry expectations.\n\nTable 4: ASHRAE Audit Levels and AI Capabilities 29\n\nAudit Level\n\nDescription\n\nKey Activities\n\nAI Model Equivalent\n\nLevel 1\n\nWalk-Through Analysis\n\nUtility bill analysis (PEA), high-level benchmarking, identification of low-cost/no-cost measures.\n\nFully Automated. The AI ingests billing data + CBECS benchmarks to produce a Preliminary Energy Use Analysis (PEA) and flag obvious outliers.\n\nLevel 2\n\nEnergy Survey & Analysis\n\nDetailed breakdown of energy use, cost-benefit analysis of specific ECMs, 12-36 months of data analysis.\n\nCore Function. The AI uses ASHRAE G14 regression to disaggregate loads and calculating savings for standard ECMs (LEDs, VFDs) using checking algorithms.\n\nLevel 3\n\nInvestment Grade Audit\n\nDynamic simulation (hourly), detailed financial modeling, risk assessment.\n\nHybrid. The AI supports this by generating the calibrated simulation (IPMVP Option D) inputs, but human engineering is typically required for complex capital measures (e.g., cogen plants).\n\nIntegration Strategy:\n\nThe AI report should explicitly state \"This analysis corresponds to an ASHRAE Level 1 Preliminary Energy Use Analysis\" or \"Level 2 Energy Survey\" based on the granularity of data provided (Monthly vs. Interval) and the depth of the retrofit recommendations.32\n\n\n\n9. Conclusion: Synthesizing the Model\n\n\n\nThe construction of an AI model for HVAC load analysis is not merely a data science challenge; it is a regulatory and physical compliance challenge. The \"best model possible\" is one that:\n\nValidates itself using ASHRAE Guideline 14 statistics (NMBE/CV-RMSE).\n\nProtects itself from physical absurdity using Thermodynamic constraints (Psychrometrics/Affinity Laws).\n\nBenchmarks itself using ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G and CBECS 2018 data.\n\nStandardizes itself using ICP Protocols for data sufficiency and documentation.\n\nBy rigidly adhering to this framework, the AI transitions from a \"Black Box\" predictor to a \"Glass Box\" engineer—transparent, compliant, and capable of unlocking the massive energy efficiency potential dormant in the global building stock.\n\nWorks cited\n\nStatistical Methodologies for Verification of Building Energy Performance Simulation Amin Nouri1, Jérôme Frisch1, Christoph va, accessed November 23, 2025, https://publications.ibpsa.org/proceedings/bs/2021/papers/bs2021_30538.pdf\n\nAccuracy of Automated Measurement and Verification (M&V) Techniques for Energy Savings in Commercial Buildings, accessed November 23, 2025, https://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/applied-energy-173-2016.pdf\n\nHow to Assess a Regression's Predictive Power for Energy Use - kW Engineering, accessed November 23, 2025, https://kw-engineering.com/how-to-assess-a-regressions-predictive-power-energy-use/\n\nWhat Is Contained in Guideline 14-2023 - ashrae, accessed November 23, 2025, https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/ashrae%20journal/haberl--additional-material--feb2023.pdf\n\nMeasurement of Energy, Demand, and Water Savings - Upgreengrade, accessed November 23, 2025, https://upgreengrade.ir/admin_panel/assets/images/books/ASHRAE%20Guideline%2014-2014.pdf\n\nPotential Analytics for Non-Routine Adjustments - Bonneville Power Administration, accessed November 23, 2025, https://www.bpa.gov/-/media/Aep/energy-efficiency/measurement-verification/nr-adj-methods-final.pdf\n\nComparison of IPMVP options and improved version of option C. - ResearchGate, accessed November 23, 2025, https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-IPMVP-options-and-improved-version-of-option-C_tbl1_236932207\n\nIPMVP - Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO), accessed November 23, 2025, https://evo-world.org/en/products-services-mainmenu-en/protocols/ipmvp\n\nIPMVP Options - WatchWire by Tango, accessed November 23, 2025, https://watchwire.ai/ipmvp-options/\n\nInternational Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol: Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings;

Introduction: The Strategic Imperative of Granular Energy Analytics\n\n\n\nThe transition toward a decarbonized built environment necessitates a paradigm shift in how energy efficiency projects are identified, quantified, and verified. Traditionally, the estimation of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) savings has been the domain of bespoke engineering audits—a high-friction, high-cost process reliant on on-site data collection and manual simulation. The objective of integrating an automated savings estimation engine into a customer-facing application represents a critical evolution in this landscape. By leveraging ubiquitous utility data (kWh, therms, interval data) alongside high-level building characteristics, we aim to democratize access to complex energy analytics, providing \"rough order of magnitude\" estimates that can drive investment decisions.\n\nThe central design challenge posited—whether to require explicit identification of system types (e.g., chillers versus boilers) or to infer them from aggregate data—touches upon the fundamental tension between user experience (UX) friction and model fidelity. This report argues that while statistical methods can characterize the behavior of a building, they cannot definitively identify the asset driving that behavior without user input or probabilistic inference. Therefore, the optimal architectural approach is a hybrid one: utilizing Inverse Modeling (statistical regression) to establish the building's thermal response profile, and Forward Modeling (physics-based simulation) to calculate specific technology savings.\n\nThis document serves as a comprehensive research and implementation guide. It details the mathematical foundations of ASHRAE Guideline 14 change-point regression, the physics of part-load efficiency curves for specific equipment classes, and the machine learning strategies required to leverage historical project data for continuous calibration. The analysis demonstrates that explicitly \"calling out\" the system type transforms the estimation process from a generic statistical correlation into a physics-informed simulation, significantly reducing uncertainty and enabling the precise targeting of capital-intensive upgrades like chiller replacements or condensing boiler retrofits.\n\n\n\n1.1 The Data Disaggregation Challenge\n\n\n\nUtility data provides a singular, aggregated signal: the total energy consumption of the facility. This signal is a composite of distinct end-uses—lighting, plug loads, vertical transport, and HVAC. To estimate the savings from a specific HVAC intervention, the analytical engine must first mathematically decouple the weather-dependent HVAC load from the base load.\n\nThe proposed input vector—Consumption (kWh/therms), Interval, Square Footage, Climate Zone, Hours of Operation, and Business Type—provides the necessary boundary conditions for this disaggregation. However, it is statistically under-determined regarding the mechanism of cooling or heating. A high correlation between outdoor temperature and electricity consumption indicates the presence of air conditioning, but it does not inherently distinguish between a Water-Cooled Centrifugal Chiller (COP ~6.0) and a Packaged Rooftop Unit (EER ~11.0). This distinction is not merely academic; it defines the baseline efficiency from which savings are calculated. A 10% efficiency improvement on a chiller yields a vastly different absolute energy reduction than a 10% improvement on a DX split system, primarily due to the distinct part-load performance profiles of these technologies.\n\n\n\n1.2 Strategic Recommendation: The \"Call Out\" Necessity\n\n\n\nThe research strongly supports the hypothesis that explicitly requesting the system type (chiller, boiler, VRF, etc.) is superior to blind inference. This input acts as a \"key\" that unlocks a library of physics-based performance curves (e.g., DOE-2 or EnergyPlus curves), allowing the engine to model how efficiency degrades or improves under varying partial load conditions.1 Without this key, the engine must resort to a \"Market Average\" baseline—a probabilistic blend of all possible technologies for a given building type—which introduces substantial variance and inevitably \"washes out\" the specific savings potential of high-performance upgrades.\n\nConsequently, the recommended workflow is a Progressive Disclosure model:\n\nLevel 1 (Inferred): The user provides basic utility and building data. The engine uses k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) clustering against the NREL ComStock database to assign the most probable system type based on the building's \"digital twin\".4\n\nLevel 2 (Explicit): The user is prompted to confirm or refine the system type (e.g., \"Is your cooling system a Chiller or Rooftop Units?\").\n\nLevel 3 (Physics-Based Calculation): The engine retrieves the specific part-load curve coefficients for the selected technology and applies them to the weather-normalized load profile derived from the utility data.\n\n\n\n2. Mathematical Framework for Baseline Modeling\n\n\n\nThe foundation of any savings estimate is a robust Baseline Model—a mathematical representation of how the building consumes energy under current conditions. The industry standard for this process is defined by ASHRAE Guideline 14, which outlines the procedures for calculating energy savings using measurements.6 The core technique is Change-Point Linear Regression, a method that correlates energy consumption with independent variables, primarily outdoor air temperature.\n\n\n\n2.1 Variable Base Degree Days (VBDD)\n\n\n\nBefore regression can occur, the raw weather data must be processed. Simple degree days (typically base 65°F) are insufficient for commercial buildings, which often have significant internal heat gains (from lighting, equipment, and occupants). These gains lower the building's \"Balance Point Temperature\"—the outdoor temperature at which the building requires neither heating nor cooling. A large office might require cooling even when it is 55°F outside, rendering a base-65°F calculation inaccurate.9\n\nThe engine must calculate Variable Base Degree Days (VBDD). The algorithm iterates through a range of potential base temperatures (e.g., 45°F to 75°F) to find the specific balance point ($T_b$) that maximizes the statistical fit ($R^2$) with the building's energy use. The calculation for a given day $d$ with hourly temperatures $T_{o,i}$ is:\n\n\n\n$$HDD_d(T_b) = \\frac{1}{24} \\sum_{i=1}^{24} (T_b - T_{o,i})^+$$\n\n\n\n$$CDD_d(T_b) = \\frac{1}{24} \\sum_{i=1}^{24} (T_{o,i} - T_b)^+$$\n\nwhere the notation $(x)^+$ indicates $\\max(x, 0)$. This integration method accounts for temperature variations within the day, providing a more accurate measure of thermal load than using daily mean temperatures.10\n\n\n\n2.2 Change-Point Regression Models\n\n\n\nOnce VBDD are established, the engine applies Piecewise Linear Regression to define the relationship between energy ($E$) and temperature ($T$). ASHRAE Guideline 14 defines three primary model topologies relevant to this application: 3-parameter (3P), 4-parameter (4P), and 5-parameter (5P) models.6\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Three-Parameter (3P) Models\n\n\n\nThe 3P model is appropriate for meters that capture baseload plus a single mode of weather-dependent load (either heating or cooling). It describes a building with a constant baseload below (or above) a change-point, and a linear dependence on temperature beyond that point.\n\n3P-Cooling (3P-C):\n\n\n\n\n\n$$E = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (T - \\beta_2)^+$$\n\n$\\beta_0$ (Baseload): The daily energy consumption independent of weather (lighting, plug loads).\n\n$\\beta_1$ (Slope): The rate of change in energy use per degree of temperature difference (kWh/°F). This parameter effectively aggregates the building's envelope thermal conductance ($UA$) and the HVAC system efficiency ($\\eta$).\n\n$\\beta_2$ (Change-Point): The outdoor temperature at which cooling begins (the Balance Point).\n\n3P-Heating (3P-H):\n\n\n\n\n\n$$E = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\beta_2 - T)^+$$\n\n\n\nThis form is typical for natural gas meters in climates where gas is used solely for space heating and domestic hot water (baseload).\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Four-Parameter (4P) Models\n\n\n\nThe 4P model introduces a distinct change in slope, which is physically representative of systems with non-linear efficiency characteristics or economizer operations. For example, a heat pump's efficiency might degrade at extreme temperatures, or a building might have different ventilation rates in different temperature bins.14\n\n4P-Cooling:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$E = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (T - \\beta_3)^+ - \\beta_2 (\\beta_3 - T)^+$$\n\n\n\nHere, the response function allows for a \"knee\" in the curve. This is particularly useful for capturing the behavior of Economizers on Rooftop Units (RTUs). If an economizer is functioning, the cooling load should be near zero (baseload) until the outdoor temperature exceeds the economizer high-limit setpoint (e.g., 70°F). A 4P model can statistically detect the temperature at which mechanical cooling engages, identifying if the economizer is broken (e.g., cooling starts at 55°F).3\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Five-Parameter (5P) Models\n\n\n\nThe 5P model is essential for buildings where a single electricity meter captures both electric heating and electric cooling (e.g., Heat Pumps or Electric Reheat systems). It defines a \"deadband\" range where neither heating nor cooling is active.7\n\n\n\n$$E = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\beta_3 - T)^+ + \\beta_2 (T - \\beta_4)^+$$\n\n$\\beta_0$: Baseload energy use.\n\n$\\beta_1$: Heating slope.\n\n$\\beta_2$: Cooling slope.\n\n$\\beta_3$: Heating change-point.\n\n$\\beta_4$: Cooling change-point.\n\nThe interval $[\\beta_3, \\beta_4]$ represents the comfort deadband where the building \"floats.\" A narrow deadband suggests tight control setpoints (simultaneous heating and cooling risk), while a wide deadband indicates good passive performance.\n\n\n\n2.3 Inverse Modeling Toolkit (IMT) Implementation\n\n\n\nTo automate the selection of the best model, the engine utilizes the algorithms originally developed for the ASHRAE Inverse Modeling Toolkit (IMT). The Python library eemeter is the modern open-source standard for this implementation.18\n\nThe core algorithm performs a Grid Search optimization:\n\nDiscretization: The potential change-point temperatures ($\\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4$) are discretized (e.g., every 1°F between the min and max observed temperatures).\n\nOLS Regression: For each candidate change-point, the problem reduces to a linear regression. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used to solve for the intercepts ($\\beta_0$) and slopes ($\\beta_1, \\beta_2$).\n\nSelection Criterion: The model with the lowest CV-RMSE (Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error) is selected as the Baseline Model.$$CV(RMSE) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-p} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}}{\\bar{y}} \\times 100$$Where $n$ is the number of data points, $p$ is the number of parameters, $y_i$ is actual usage, $\\hat{y}_i$ is predicted usage, and $\\bar{y}$ is the mean usage.21\n\nA CV-RMSE below 20% for monthly data (or 30% for hourly data) typically indicates a model sufficiently robust for savings estimation.16 If the error is higher, the engine should flag the building as \"Non-Routine,\" possibly requiring human intervention or advanced Grey-Box modeling.\n\n\n\n3. Physics-Based Disaggregation: The \"Call Out\" Advantage\n\n\n\nWhile the statistical baseline determines the total weather-sensitive consumption, it lumps the HVAC load and the HVAC efficiency into a single slope parameter ($\\beta_1$). To estimate the savings from a technology upgrade (e.g., replacing a chiller), we must mathematically separate the Load (thermal demand) from the Efficiency (equipment performance). This separation is impossible with utility data alone; it requires physical priors. This is where the user input of \"System Type\" becomes the critical differentiator.\n\n\n\n3.1 Equipment Performance Curves\n\n\n\nDifferent HVAC technologies exhibit distinct efficiency profiles as a function of load and ambient conditions. By knowing the system type, the engine can map the statistical load profile to a specific efficiency curve, allowing for a much more precise calculation of the baseline thermal load.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Chillers: The Impact of Lift and Load\n\n\n\nChillers are fundamentally different from DX units. Their efficiency is heavily dependent on \"Lift\"—the pressure difference between the condenser and evaporator.\n\nWater-Cooled Centrifugal Chillers: These units benefit significantly from \"relief.\" As the outdoor wet-bulb temperature drops, the cooling tower produces colder water, reducing lift and drastically improving efficiency (lowering kW/ton). They often operate most efficiently at 50-70% part load.2\n\nAir-Cooled Chillers: These are dependent on dry-bulb temperature and generally have lower peak efficiencies and different part-load degradation curves compared to water-cooled units.2\n\nThe mathematical model for a chiller in simulation engines like EnergyPlus is the Bi-Quadratic Curve 22:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$EIR = f(T_{chws}, T_{conds}, PLR)$$\n\n\n\nWhere $EIR$ (Energy Input Ratio) is the inverse of COP. The curve is a function of leaving chilled water temperature ($T_{chws}$), entering condenser water temperature ($T_{conds}$), and Part Load Ratio ($PLR$).\n\nWithout \"Call Out\": The engine must assume a linear degradation or a generic \"average\" curve.\n\nWith \"Call Out\": If the user selects \"Water-Cooled Chiller,\" the engine applies the DOE-2.1E generic centrifugal chiller curve. This curve might show that at 65°F outdoor temperature, the chiller is operating at 0.45 kW/ton. A generic curve might assume 1.0 kW/ton. This difference of >50% in the baseline assumption directly translates to a >50% error in the savings estimate for a new machine.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Boilers: The Condensing Threshold\n\n\n\nBoiler efficiency is driven by the Return Water Temperature (RWT).\n\nNon-Condensing Boilers: These operate with RWT > 140°F to prevent flue gas condensation (which causes corrosion). Their efficiency is capped at roughly 80-82% and is relatively flat across part-load ratios.23\n\nCondensing Boilers: These are designed to operate with RWT < 130°F. When the water is cold enough to condense the flue gas, the latent heat of vaporization is recovered, boosting efficiency to 90-98%.25\n\nThe efficiency equation is:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$Eff = Eff_{nom} \\times f(PLR) \\times f(RWT)$$\n\nWith \"Call Out\": If the user specifies \"Non-Condensing Boiler,\" the engine knows the baseline efficiency is likely ~80%. More importantly, it allows the engine to check the feasibility of a condensing retrofit. If the 3P-H regression shows a very steep heating slope ($\\beta_1$), implying high heating loads even at mild temperatures, the building may require high-temperature water, potentially limiting the savings from a condensing boiler unless the emitters (radiators/coils) are also upgraded.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Rooftop Units (RTUs): Cycling and Economizers\n\n\n\nRTUs, particularly older constant-volume units, suffer from \"cycling losses\" at low loads. The compressor turns on and off to meet demand, which is inefficient compared to the variable modulation of a chiller or VRF system.\n\nPerformance Curve: RTU efficiency is typically modeled using EER and a Part Load Fraction (PLF) correlation 3:$$COP_{effective} = COP_{rated} \\times PLF(PLR)$$\n\nEconomizers: The \"Call Out\" allows the engine to ask about economizers. If the user selects \"RTU\" and the statistical baseline (4P model) shows a change-point at 55°F, the engine can infer that the economizer is either absent or broken (mechanical cooling is fighting free cooling). Fixing this is a low-cost, high-impact measure that the engine can recommend specifically because it identified the asset type.\n\n\n\n3.2 Mathematical Disaggregation Strategy\n\n\n\nThe process of using these curves to separate Load from Efficiency involves the following algorithm:\n\nDetermine Weather-Dependent Energy ($E_{wd}$): From the statistical baseline (e.g., 3P-C), calculate the daily cooling energy: $E_{wd} = \\beta_1 (T - \\beta_2)^+$.\n\nEstimate Hourly Load Profile: Use the \"Business Type\" (e.g., Office) to map the daily $E_{wd}$ to an hourly profile based on NREL ComStock operational schedules.4\n\nApply Baseline Curve:\n\nRetrieve the performance curve for the \"Called Out\" system (e.g., Chiller:Electric:EIR).\n\nSolve for the Thermal Load ($Q_{thermal}$) at each hour $t$:$$Q_{thermal}(t) = E_{wd}(t) \\times COP_{curve}(T_{outdoor}(t), PLR(t))$$\n\nSince $PLR$ depends on $Q_{thermal}$ (which is unknown), this equation must be solved iteratively.\n\nCalculate Savings:\n\nSelect the \"Proposed\" system curve (e.g., Magnetic Bearing Chiller).\n\nCalculate new energy use: $E_{new}(t) = Q_{thermal}(t) / COP_{new\\_curve}(t)$.\n\nSum the difference: Savings = $\\sum (E_{wd}(t) - E_{new}(t))$.\n\nThis physics-based disaggregation provides a far more defensible savings estimate than simply applying a percentage improvement to the raw utility bill.\n\n\n\n4. Data-Driven Research: Archetypes and Digital Twins\n\n\n\nTo fuel the physics-based models when user inputs are sparse, the engine requires a rich backend of \"Default Assumptions\" or \"Priors.\" This is where the research into public datasets becomes operational.\n\n\n\n4.1 Integrating NREL ComStock\n\n\n\nComStock is the premier dataset for US commercial building energy modeling. It contains roughly 350,000 energy models representing the diversity of the national building stock.4 The \"End-Use Load Profiles\" dataset, derived from ComStock, provides 15-minute calibrated load profiles for every building type and climate zone.27\n\nResearch Strategy:\n\nData Acquisition: The dataset is hosted on the Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) Data Lake on AWS S3. The bucket structure is s3://oedi-data-lake/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/.29\n\nArchetype Extraction: The engine should pre-process this data to create a \"Digital Twin Lookup Table.\"\n\nKeys: Building Type (e.g., Retail), Climate Zone (e.g., 3A), Vintage (Pre-1980, Post-2004).\n\nValues: Normalized HVAC EUI (kWh/ft²), HVAC-to-Baseload Ratio, Typical Operating Schedule.\n\nApplication: When a user uploads data for a \"Restaurant in Atlanta\" but provides no other details, the engine queries the ComStock table. It finds that the median HVAC load for this archetype is 45% of total electric. It uses this ratio to \"sanity check\" the statistical baseline derived from the customer's meter. If the regression says 10% HVAC, the engine flags a potential anomaly (e.g., broken meter, 24/7 operation).\n\n\n\n4.2 DOE Commercial Reference Buildings\n\n\n\nWhile ComStock provides the load profiles, the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings provide the equipment specifications. These are 16 EnergyPlus models that represent standard construction practices.31\n\nResearch Strategy:\n\nCurve Extraction: Researchers should download the EnergyPlus input files (IDFs) for these reference buildings.\n\nDatabase Creation: Parse the IDFs to extract the coefficients for Chiller:Electric:EIR, Boiler:HotWater, and Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed objects.22\n\nUsage: These become the \"Default Curves\" in the engine. When a user says \"I have a Chiller\" but doesn't know the model, the engine defaults to the curve from the \"Large Office Reference Building\" for that climate zone. This ensures the baseline efficiency assumption is compliant with ASHRAE 90.1 standards for that vintage.\n\n\n\n4.3 CBECS for Probabilistic Inference\n\n\n\nThe Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) provides statistical distributions of equipment types.33\n\nBayesian Priors: If the user does not call out the system type, CBECS data allows the engine to calculate probabilities.\n\nFact: 50,000 sqft Office in NY (Zone 4A).\n\nCBECS Probability: 20% chance of Chiller, 70% chance of RTU, 10% chance of Heat Pump.\n\nEngine Logic: The engine can calculate savings for both a Chiller and an RTU scenario and present a weighted average range: \"Estimated Savings: $5,000 - $8,000 (depending on system type).\" This transparency builds trust with the user.\n\n\n\n5. Leveraging Historical Data: The k-Nearest Neighbors Approach\n\n\n\nThe request mentions \"using our past project data.\" This is a critical asset for closing the \"Performance Gap\"—the difference between theoretical savings (physics models) and realized savings. To operationalize this, we recommend a Case-Based Reasoning system using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) clustering.\n\n\n\n5.1 The k-NN Algorithm\n\n\n\nk-NN is a non-parametric method that predicts the value of a new point based on the values of the $k$ closest training examples in the feature space.35\n\nAlgorithm Steps:\n\nFeature Vector Construction: Every past project $P$ and the new customer building $C$ are represented as vectors of normalized features:$$V =$$\n\nNorm_EUI: Annual kWh / SqFt.\n\nHDD/CDD Intensity: Total degree days for the location.\n\nLoad Factor: Average Demand / Peak Demand (captures \"peaky\" vs. flat profiles).\n\nBusiness Type: One-hot encoded (e.g., for School).\n\nDistance Calculation: Calculate the Euclidean Distance (or Cosine Similarity) between the new customer $C$ and all past projects $P_i$:$$D(C, P_i) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^m w_j (C_j - P_{i,j})^2}$$Weights ($w_j$) are critical. \"Business Type\" and \"Climate Zone\" should be heavily weighted to ensure an Office in Florida isn't compared to a Warehouse in Maine.38\n\nRetrieval & Calibration: Identify the 5 nearest neighbors ($k=5$). Retrieve their Realized Savings Rates for relevant measures.\n\nExample: The math model predicts 25% savings for a Chiller upgrade.\n\nk-NN Result: The 5 most similar past projects achieved an average of 18% savings.\n\nAdjustment: The engine applies a \"Realization Factor\" of $18/25 = 0.72$ to the physics-based estimate, presenting a \"Calibration-Adjusted\" savings number that reflects real-world operational friction (e.g., overrides, maintenance issues).\n\n\n\n5.2 Implementation in Python\n\n\n\nThe scikit-learn library is the standard tool for this.40\n\nPreprocessing: Use StandardScaler to normalize features (mean=0, variance=1) so that large numbers (SqFt) don't dominate small numbers (Load Factor).\n\nClustering: Use sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.\n\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW): For advanced implementation, compare the shapes of the load profiles directly using DTW. This measures similarity between temporal sequences which may vary in speed or phase.41 A building with a \"Morning Warm-up\" spike will naturally cluster with other buildings having that spike, ensuring that operational schedules are matched.\n\n\n\n6. Implementation Architecture: The Tech Stack\n\n\n\nTo bring this \"math and research\" to life, a robust software architecture is required. The Python ecosystem is uniquely suited for this due to its dominance in both energy modeling and data science.\n\n\n\n6.1 Core Libraries\n\n\n\neeweather: 20\n\nFunction: Automatic mapping of lat/long to the nearest reliable NOAA weather station (ISD/GSOD). It handles data cleaning, gap filling, and normalization.\n\nWhy: Eliminates the manual step of finding weather files.\n\neemeter: 19\n\nFunction: The Open Energy Efficiency Meter. It is the reference implementation of the CalTrack (ASHRAE G14) methods. It automates the grid search for 3P/4P/5P models and calculates uncertainty metrics.\n\nWhy: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use the industry-standard open-source calculation engine.\n\nscikit-learn: 40\n\nFunction: Implements the k-NN clustering and regression algorithms.\n\nWhy: Robust, scalable machine learning.\n\npandas & numpy:\n\nFunction: High-performance time-series manipulation. Resampling 15-minute interval data to hourly or daily resolution for regression.\n\n\n\n6.2 Grey-Box Modeling (Advanced Option)\n\n\n\nFor users who provide high-frequency interval data (15-minute), the engine can deploy Grey-Box (RC) Models.44\n\nConcept: The building is modeled as an electrical circuit (Resistors = Insulation, Capacitors = Thermal Mass).\n\nEquation: A 2R1C model (2 Resistors, 1 Capacitor):$$C \\frac{dT_{in}}{dt} = \\frac{T_{out} - T_{in}}{R_{ea}} + Q_{sun} + Q_{int} + Q_{HVAC}$$\n\nSolution: Use scipy.optimize to find the parameter set $\\{R, C\\}$ that minimizes the error between the modeled and actual internal temperature (or load).47\n\nValue: This separates the envelope performance from the HVAC performance. It allows the app to answer: \"What if I improve insulation?\" vs \"What if I replace the HVAC?\" independently, which pure statistical regression cannot do.\n\n\n\n6.3 Application Workflow\n\n\n\nIngestion: App accepts GreenButton XML or CSV.\n\nValidation: Check for data sufficiency (minimum 12 months).\n\nContextualization: eeweather pulls coincident weather data.\n\nInverse Modeling: eemeter runs CalTrack methods to derive $\\beta$ coefficients (Baseline Model).\n\nDisaggregation:\n\nCheck for \"System Type\" input.\n\nIf Null $\\rightarrow$ Query ComStock k-NN $\\rightarrow$ Infer System.\n\nIf Present $\\rightarrow$ Query DOE Reference DB $\\rightarrow$ Get Curve Coefficients.\n\nApply Curve to $\\beta_1$ slope to separate Load from Efficiency.\n\nSimulation: Calculate $E_{new}$ using proposed equipment curves.\n\nCalibration: Adjust estimate using historical project realization rates.\n\nOutput: Present \"Estimated Savings Range\" with confidence intervals derived from CV-RMSE.\n\n\n\n7. Conclusion\n\n\n\nThe integration of an HVAC savings estimator requires a sophisticated orchestration of statistical methods and physical data. The answer to the user's core query is unequivocal: Yes, calling out the system type is crucial. It acts as the bridge between the observable (utility bill) and the actionable (equipment retrofit). Without it, the system is blind to the specific physics of the savings opportunity.\n\nBy adopting the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Architecture outlined above, the app can provide estimates that are not merely \"rough guesses\" but are scientifically defensible, rooted in ASHRAE standards, and calibrated by the ground truth of historical projects. This approach minimizes user friction through intelligent defaults (ComStock) while rewarding detailed inputs with higher-precision outputs, creating a scalable engine for energy efficiency discovery.\n\n\n\n8.

Little heating savings in coastal mild zones.\n\n23.4 Climate Zone Interaction Matrix AI must use a predefined matrix of multipliers for each EEM by climate zone.\n\nExample (illustrative only): SAT reset: +20% savings in mild climates, −30% in humid climates Economizer: +50% in mild climates, −50% in humid climates CHW reset: +10–20% in hot climates, negligible in cold climates\n\n23.5 Climate Data Sources AI should estimate using: CZ-based averages Weather file profiles ASHRAE climate tables\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 24 — REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.1 Hospital Example System: CHW plant + boilers + VAV Measures: CHW reset CW reset Static pressure reset SAT reset DCV\n\nExpected savings: Cooling: 12–25% Heating: 20–40% Fan: 15–35%\n\nConstraints: Humidity control 24/7 occupancy High internal load\n\n24.2 School Example System: RTUs + boiler Measures: DCV Economizer repair Boiler reset Fan VFDs\n\nExpected savings: Cooling: 10–20% Heating: 20–40% Fan: 10–30%\n\n24.3 Office Example System: VAV + AHU + boiler Measures: SP reset SAT reset CHW reset Scheduling\n\nExpected savings: Cooling: 10–15% Heating: 10–20% Fan: 20–40%\n\n24.4 Industrial Example System: RTUs Measures: RTU controls Economizer tuning Scheduling\n\nExpected savings: Cooling: 5–10% Fan: 10–20%\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 25 — HVAC VALIDATION MATRIX\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.1 Purpose Ensures AI predictions are physically realistic and compliant with HVAC engineering best practices.\n\n25.2 Validation Test Cases\n\nTest 1 — Impossible SAT Reset If climate zone = humid, SAT reset > 3°F → fail\n\nTest 2 — Double-Counting Cooling + Reheat If cooling savings and reheat savings exceed 30% simultaneously → fail\n\nTest 3 — Economizer Feasibility If OA enthalpy > RA enthalpy, economizer savings > 0 → fail\n\nTest 4 — Pump Savings Overstatement If pump savings > 40% without major retrofit → fail\n\nTest 5 — Boiler Reset If RWT never drops below 130°F, condensing boiler savings > 5% → fail\n\nTest 6 — VAV Fan Savings If SP reset implies >40% fan savings, flag unrealistic\n\nTest 7 — Chiller COP Upgrade If chiller upgrade predicts >50% cooling savings → fail\n\nTest 8 — Heating Dominated Climate If DCV heating savings < 10% in cold climate → probably low but unlikely fail If >50% → fail\n\n25.3 AI Response to Failed Tests If test fails: AI must not produce savings AI must flag unrealistic assumption AI must revise inputs or request clarification\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 26 — AI IMPLEMENTATION RULES\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.1 Required Inputs Building type Square footage Climate zone Interval data (optional but preferred) Gas usage Cooling and heating seasons HVAC system type Operating schedules\n\n26.2 Modeling Sequence 1 System identification 2 Load distribution 3 HVAC measure modeling 4 Interaction modeling 5 Climate zone adjustment 6 Apply constraints 7 Compute savings 8 Summaries + caveats\n\n26.3 Output Requirements AI must output: Cooling savings Heating savings Fan savings Pump savings Reheat savings Narrative explanation Assumptions Warnings Confidence level\n\n26.4 Human Explanation Framework AI must explain: Why system type identified How load distribution determined Why measures were selected Why measures were rejected Where savings came from What constraints applied\n\n26.5 Consistency Rule All outputs must be internally consistent with building physics.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEND OF PDF #4 — HVAC OPTIMIZATION MODELING MANUAL\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n",
