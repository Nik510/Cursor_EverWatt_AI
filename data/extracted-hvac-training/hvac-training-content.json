    "content": "Comprehensive HVAC Energy Audit Framework and Field Data Collection Standards for EverWatt\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe optimization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represents the single most significant opportunity for operational cost reduction and decarbonization in commercial and industrial facilities. However, the efficacy of any energy conservation measure (ECM) is fundamentally limited by the quality of the initial data upon which it is based. For EverWatt to deliver superior engineering audits that transcend simple equipment inventories, the field data collection process must evolve into a rigorous diagnostic investigation. This report establishes a standardized, exhaustive protocol for EverWatt’s HVAC audit teams, designed to bridge the gap between initial site walkthroughs and complex engineering modeling.\n\nThis framework moves beyond merely identifying what equipment is present to understanding how it operates, why it consumes energy at its current rate, and where the thermodynamic inefficiencies lie. We are not just counting units; we are profiling the metabolic rate of the building. This document is structured into distinct \"Data Collection Modules,\" each providing a field-ready checklist template embedded within a deep-dive technical analysis. This structure ensures that every data point collected has a clear engineering purpose, whether it is to calibrate a load simulation, justify a capital expenditure, or identify an immediate low-cost operational improvement. By strictly adhering to these protocols, EverWatt mitigates the risk of modeling errors, reduces the necessity for costly return site visits, and uncovers high-value savings opportunities that surface-level assessments routinely miss.\n\nPart I: Audit Safety, Tools, and Pre-Site Preparation\n\nBefore a single piece of equipment is inspected, the foundational elements of safety, access, and diagnostic capability must be established. An HVAC audit involves interaction with high-voltage electrical systems, high-pressure steam and refrigerant vessels, rotating machinery, and potentially hazardous chemical environments. The auditor’s preparedness directly correlates to the depth and safety of the audit.\n\n1.1 Field Safety Protocols and Risk Assessment\n\nThe safety of the EverWatt team is paramount. HVAC environments are dynamic and often hazardous. Auditors must navigate mechanical rooms that may have been neglected for years, presenting risks ranging from biological hazards in cooling towers to electrical arc flash potential in control panels.\n\nModule 1: Safety & Access Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Item\n\nStatus\n\nGuidance / Action Required / Rationale\n\nPPE Verified\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nMandatory: Hard hat, safety glasses (Z87+), steel-toed boots, ear protection (especially for chiller/boiler rooms >85dB), and cut-resistant gloves. Why: Mechanical rooms contain sharp sheet metal, low overhead clearances, and high noise levels that can cause long-term hearing damage.\n\nLockout/Tagout (LOTO)\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nVerify facility LOTO procedures. Crucial: Never open electrical panels (remove dead fronts) without facility electrician support. Assume all capacitors in VFDs retain lethal charge even after power is cut.\n\nConfined Space\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nIdentify plenums, tanks, crawlspaces, or air handlers large enough to enter. Rule: DO NOT ENTER without certification and facility authorization. Confined spaces can accumulate CO or displace oxygen.1\n\nRoof Access\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nCheck ladder condition, hatch security, and perimeter guarding. Avoid roof edges (<6ft) without fall protection. Context: RTU inspections often require traversing compromised roof membranes.\n\nChemical Hazards\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nNote presence of ammonia (refrigeration), hydrazine (boilers), or biocides (cooling towers). Ensure proper ventilation. Insight: Ammonia leaks are immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).\n\nAsbestos Awareness\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nIn buildings pre-1980, assume pipe insulation (especially on steam lines and boilers) is asbestos. Action: Do not disturb or scrape insulation for identification.\n\nBiological Hazards\n\n☐ Yes ☐ No\n\nCheck for standing water in drain pans (Legionella risk) or bird droppings near intakes (Histoplasmosis risk).2\n\nTechnical Rationale: Operational Safety & Liability\n\nThe operational environment of a mechanical plant is unforgiving. For instance, cooling towers are notorious breeding grounds for Legionella pneumophila if water treatment programs fail. An auditor breathing in mist from a poorly maintained tower puts themselves at risk. Similarly, high-pressure steam leaks in boiler rooms can be invisible (\"dry steam\") and capable of cutting through protective clothing instantly. The checklists provided here are not merely bureaucratic hurdles; they are life-safety requirements. Furthermore, understanding the safety status of a facility provides immediate insight into the quality of maintenance. A mechanical room littered with debris, bypassed safety switches, or missing belt guards is a leading indicator of deferred maintenance, suggesting that the HVAC equipment itself is likely operating far below its design efficiency.1\n\n1.2 Essential Diagnostic Tools for the Auditor\n\nTo move beyond a visual inspection (\"The unit is there\") to a diagnostic inspection (\"The unit is failing\"), EverWatt auditors must deploy specific diagnostic tools. The \"eyeball test\" is insufficient for energy engineering. We need quantitative data to build our baselines.\n\nInfrared (Thermal) Camera: This is indispensable for non-contact diagnostics. It allows the auditor to see temperature differentials that indicate failure.\n\nApplication: Detecting insulation voids in the building envelope, identifying overheating electrical breakers (indicating high resistance/loose connections), verifying coil performance (uniform temperature distribution vs. blocked circuits), and spotting steam trap failures (trap is hot on both sides, indicating blow-through).4\n\nCombustion Analyzer: Required for any boiler audit. A blue flame does not guarantee efficiency. We need to measure Oxygen (O2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and net stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency and excess air.6\n\nAnemometer / Manometer: These measure airflow velocity and static pressure. High static pressure drops across filters or coils indicate flow restrictions that exponentially increase fan energy consumption. The manometer is the \"blood pressure cuff\" of the airside system.8\n\nUltrasonic Flow Meter: A non-invasive method to measure fluid flow (GPM) in chilled water or hot water loops without cutting pipes. This verifies if pumps are oversized or if flow is being throttled.\n\nPower Logger / Clamp Meter: For spot-checking instantaneous voltage and amperage of motors to compare against nameplate ratings. This validates the actual load factor of the equipment.\n\nPsychrometer: Measures dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, allowing for the calculation of relative humidity and enthalpy. This is critical for assessing cooling tower performance and economizer operation.\n\nPart II: Facility Operation & Building Envelope Assessment\n\nThe HVAC system does not exist in a vacuum; it is a reactive system designed to counteract the thermal loads imposed by the building envelope and internal processes. Therefore, the audit must begin with a thorough characterization of the building itself. If we do not understand the building's physics and operation, we cannot model the baseline energy usage accurately.\n\n2.1 Facility Operation Profile\n\nThe operational profile defines the \"when\" and \"how much\" of energy consumption. A primary error in energy auditing is assuming standard operating hours (e.g., 9-5) for facilities that may have cleaning crews at night, weekend shifts, or critical loads running 24/7.\n\nModule 2: Facility & Operational Data Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry Requirement\n\nField Guidance & Technical Rationale\n\nFacility Type\n\n☐ Hospital ☐ School ☐ Office ☐ Retail ☐ Industrial ☐ Data Center\n\nRationale: Dictates ventilation codes (ASHRAE 62.1 vs 170) and internal load density. A hospital requires 100% outside air in many zones, driving massive heating/cooling loads compared to an office.10\n\nPrimary Function\n\n____________________\n\nDescribe the activity: e.g., \"Plastic Injection Molding\" vs \"Software Development.\" Why: Manufacturing creates massive internal heat gains; offices are envelope-dominated.\n\nBuilding Size\n\n____________________ sq. ft.\n\nCritical: Used to calculate Energy Use Intensity (EUI = kBtu/sq.ft./yr). If drawings aren't available, pace it out or use Google Earth.\n\nBuilding Age\n\n______ Years\n\nContext: hints at insulation standards (pre-1980 often poor) and glazing technology (single pane vs low-e).\n\nWeekly Operating Hours\n\nWeekday: ____ Weekend: ____\n\nDefine \"Occupied\" vs \"Unoccupied\" setpoints. Why: Critical for baseline energy modeling and scheduling ECMs.\n\nOccupancy Density\n\n______ People/1000sf\n\nEstimate peak vs average. Why: Humans are heat engines (~500 BTU/hr total heat). High density = high cooling load and high ventilation requirement.\n\nProcess Loads\n\n☐ Servers ☐ Medical Imaging ☐ Manufacturing ☐ Kitchens\n\nRationale: These are constant internal heat gains (base loads) unrelated to weather. They must be modeled separately from the HVAC load.10\n\nUtility Rate Structure\n\nElec: $/kWh Demand: $/kW Gas: $___/Therm\n\nFinancial Impact: ECMs that reduce peak demand (kW) are more valuable in high-demand-charge territories.\n\nMaintenance Staff\n\n____________________\n\nName/Contact. Why: Their knowledge of \"buried bodies\" (hidden problems) is invaluable.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Load Profiling and Operational Dynamics\n\nUnderstanding the \"Why\" behind these fields is crucial for the auditor.\n\nLoad Decoupling: We must separate weather-dependent loads (conduction through walls, solar gain) from base loads (lighting, servers, process equipment). A data center operates 8,760 hours a year with a massive cooling load even when it is -20°F outside due to server heat. Conversely, a school operates ~2,000 hours a year and its load is dominated by the need to heat/cool fresh air for students. Confusing these profiles leads to disastrously inaccurate energy models.\n\nScheduling Opportunities: The simplest, highest-ROI ECM is often scheduling. If a building operates 24/7 but only needs strict temperature control from 8 AM to 6 PM, implementing temperature setbacks during unoccupied hours can save 10-20% of HVAC energy immediately without buying new equipment. The auditor must ask: \"Why is this running right now?\".11\n\nUtility Rate Impact: The \"Electric Rate Schedule\" 10 dictates the financial viability of projects. If a client pays high demand charges ($/kW), thermal storage or load-shedding strategies become viable. If they pay flat rates, efficiency (kWh reduction) is the priority.\n\n2.2 Building Envelope Inspection\n\nThe envelope (walls, roof, windows, foundation) acts as the barrier to heat flow. An HVAC system is simply a machine designed to counteract the failure of the envelope to maintain interior conditions. A leaky bucket requires the tap to run constantly; sealing the bucket (the envelope) allows us to turn down the tap (the HVAC).\n\nModule 3: Envelope Integrity Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Point\n\nObservation / Data Entry\n\nWhy This Matters for the Audit\n\nWindow Type\n\n☐ Single ☐ Double ☐ Tinted ☐ Low-E\n\nPhysics: Single pane glass has a U-factor of ~1.0 (R-1). Double pane is ~0.5. This drives conduction load. Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) drives cooling load.\n\nWindow Condition\n\n☐ Sealed ☐ Drafty ☐ Fogged\n\nFogged glass means the seal is broken and the insulating gas (Argon) has escaped.\n\nDoor Seals\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Gaps Visible\n\nVisual Cue: If you can see daylight under a door, air is rushing in. This \"infiltration\" adds latent load (humidity) and sensible load.\n\nWall Insulation\n\n☐ Good ☐ Unknown ☐ Thermal Bridges\n\nUse thermal camera. Look for \"thermal bridging\"—metal studs or beams conducting heat through the wall, bypassing insulation.\n\nRoof Color/Type\n\n☐ Black (EPDM/Tar) ☐ White (TPO/PVC)\n\nCooling Load: A black roof can reach 160°F in summer, conducting massive heat into the building. A white roof stays near ambient, reducing cooling load.12\n\nRoof Insulation\n\n☐ Dry ☐ Wet/Compressed\n\nWet insulation has an R-value of nearly zero. It acts as a conductor. Identifying wet roof sections via thermal imaging is a critical finding.\n\nWall/Floor Joins\n\n☐ Sealed ☐ Drafty\n\nMajor source of infiltration. Air leaks here often bring in unconditioned, humid air, stressing the latent capacity of the AC.\n\nVestibules\n\n☐ Present ☐ Absent\n\nDo main entries have a double-door airlock? If not, wind blows conditioned air right out.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Thermal Dynamics and Infiltration\n\nInfiltration (Air Leakage): Uncontrolled air leakage forces the HVAC system to condition outside air that hasn't passed through a dedicated intake or energy recovery unit. This is the most expensive air to treat because it enters at extreme temperatures. The auditor should look for \"cobwebs moving\" near corners or verify if the building is positively pressurized (doors push open) or negatively pressurized (doors suck shut). Negative pressure sucks in unconditioned air, causing humidity problems and drafts.13\n\nSolar Heat Gain: In commercial buildings with high glass-to-wall ratios, solar gain is often the dominant cooling load. Auditors should note the orientation of glass. West-facing glass causes late-afternoon peak loads that align with peak utility pricing. Tinting or shading these windows is a prime ECM.\n\nInsulation Integrity: It is not enough to know if there is insulation; we must know its condition. Compressed fiberglass loses its R-value. Wet roof insulation not only loses thermal resistance but can destroy the roof deck. The thermal camera is the tool of choice here, revealing cold/hot spots that the naked eye misses.4\n\nPart III: Airside Systems (RTUs, AHUs, and Ductwork)\n\nThe airside system is the mechanism of heat exchange between the central plant (or refrigerant circuit) and the occupied space. It is the \"lungs\" of the building. This section covers Package Rooftop Units (RTUs), Air Handling Units (AHUs), and the distribution ductwork.\n\n3.1 Rooftop Unit (RTU) Audit\n\nRTUs are the ubiquitous workhorses of commercial HVAC, commonly found on retail, light industrial, and office buildings. They are self-contained \"package\" units.\n\nModule 4: RTU Field Data Collection\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nField Guidance / Visual Cues / Technical Note\n\nUnit Tag / ID\n\n____________________\n\nMatch to site plan (e.g., RTU-1, AC-3).\n\nMake / Model\n\n____________________\n\nEssential: Photograph the nameplate. This is the DNA of the unit.\n\nSerial Number\n\n____________________\n\nDecodes the Date of Manufacture. Age Rule: Systems >15 years are nearing end of life and are prime for replacement.15\n\nTonnage / Capacity\n\n____________________ MBH/Tons\n\n12,000 BTU/hr = 1 Ton. Look for numbers divisible by 12 in the model # (e.g., ZP060 = 60k BTU = 5 tons).\n\nCompressor Condition\n\n☐ Running ☐ Short Cycling ☐ Noisy\n\nListen: Does it turn on and off every <5 minutes? This is \"short cycling\" and kills efficiency. Check for oil stains on piping (leaks).\n\nCondenser Coil\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Dirty/Impacted ☐ Fin Damage\n\nLook for \"matting\" (a layer of dirt/cottonwood) or bent fins from hail. Dirty coils raise head pressure, increasing amp draw.\n\nEconomizer Status\n\n☐ Functioning ☐ Stuck Open ☐ Stuck Closed\n\nCritical: Is the damper stuck? Open the hood. Are wires disconnected? Is the linkage rusted? A stuck economizer is a massive energy waster.16\n\nFan Belt Condition\n\n☐ Tight ☐ Loose/Squealing ☐ Worn\n\nPush the belt: >1/2\" deflection = loose. Look for black rubber dust on the guard (slipping belt).\n\nThermostat Settings\n\nSet: ____ Actual: ____ Mode: ____\n\nIs the unit running when the building is unoccupied? Is the fan set to \"On\" (runs 24/7) instead of \"Auto\"?\n\nGas Heat\n\n☐ Present ☐ Electric Heat\n\nIf gas, check flue for soot (bad combustion). If electric, note kW.\n\nTechnical Rationale: RTU Efficiency and Failure Modes\n\nEconomizer Diagnostics: The economizer is a damper system that brings in cool outside air to cool the building without running the compressor (\"free cooling\"). It is the first component to fail and often goes unnoticed.\n\nStuck Open: If stuck open in summer, the unit pulls in 95°F/90% humidity air, overwhelming the coil and causing humidity issues and high energy bills.\n\nStuck Closed: If stuck closed in winter/spring (e.g., 55°F outside), the unit must run mechanical compressors to cool the core of the building, wasting free cooling potential.\n\nAudit Action: The auditor must physically inspect the damper linkage. If it is zip-tied shut or the actuator is hanging loose, mark it as \"Failed\".17\n\nShort Cycling: If a compressor runs for 3 minutes and shuts off, then restarts 2 minutes later, it is \"short cycling.\" This destroys the compressor (due to heat buildup in windings) and ruins efficiency (SEER) because the system never reaches steady-state operation. It indicates oversizing, low refrigerant charge (safety switch tripping), or a blocked coil.19\n\nCondenser Coils: The condenser rejects heat to the outdoors. If the coil is plugged with dirt (\"sweater\"), the refrigerant cannot condense properly. The pressure rises (head pressure), forcing the compressor to work harder and draw more amps. A 10% reduction in airflow can degrade efficiency by 5-10% and capacity by even more.15\n\n3.2 Air Handling Unit (AHU) Deep Dive\n\nAHUs are generally larger, indoor units that may be connected to a central plant (chillers/boilers) or have their own DX (Direct Expansion) cooling. They serve larger zones and have more complex controls.\n\nModule 5: AHU Detailed Inspection Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Technical Note\n\nSupply Fan Type\n\n☐ Centrifugal ☐ Axial ☐ Plenum\n\nNote if VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) is present.\n\nVFD Frequency\n\n______ Hz\n\nGolden Nugget: If the VFD display reads \"60.00 Hz\" constantly, the VFD is bypassed or the controls have failed. It is running at full speed unnecessarily.21\n\nStatic Pressure\n\nSupply: ___\" wc Return: ___\" wc\n\n\"Blood Pressure\": High supply static (>1.5\" wc for typical office) means blocked filters or closed dampers. Low static means a blown duct or broken belt.8\n\nFilter Condition\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Loaded\n\nCheck the Differential Pressure (DP) gauge (e.g., Magnehelic). >0.5\" wc drop usually means replace. High DP kills fan efficiency.22\n\nCooling Coil Valve\n\n☐ Modulating ☐ Hunting\n\nWatch the actuator. Is it constantly moving open/closed? This is \"hunting\" and wastes energy while wearing out the valve.\n\nChilled Water Temp\n\nIn: ___°F Out: ___°F\n\nDelta T: The temperature difference (ΔT) should be ~10-12°F (e.g., 44°F in, 54°F out). Low ΔT (<5°F) indicates \"Low Delta T Syndrome.\"\n\nDuct Leakage\n\n☐ Audible ☐ Visible\n\nListen for hissing. Look for unsealed joints, blown-off tape, or gaps at the unit connection.\n\nO.A. Damper\n\n% Open: ______\n\nMinimum Outside Air (O.A.) should be set for code (e.g., 10-20%). If it's 50% open on a hot day, energy is being wasted.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Airside Dynamics & Static Pressure\n\nStatic Pressure Analysis: Static pressure is the resistance the fan must overcome to move air. It is measured in inches of water column (w.c.).\n\nHigh Static: If the static pressure is high, the fan motor works harder, drawing more amps. Causes include dirty filters, crushed ducts, or fire dampers that have slammed shut.\n\nLow Static: Indicates the fan is spinning but not building pressure—likely a broken belt or a large disconnect in the supply duct.9\n\nLow Delta T Syndrome: In a chilled water system, the water is the transport medium for heat. If water enters the coil at 44°F and leaves at 46°F (ΔT = 2°F), the water is moving too fast through the coil to pick up heat (laminar flow issues or fouled coil). This forces the central plant pumps to pump massive amounts of water to do very little cooling work. It also wreaks havoc on chiller efficiency.24\n\nFilter Pressure Drop: As filters load with dirt, the pressure drop across them increases. In a system with a VFD, the fan speeds up to compensate, using more energy. In a constant volume system, airflow decreases, reducing cooling capacity. Modern \"high efficiency\" filters (MERV 13+) have higher initial pressure drops; the system must be designed to handle this penalty.25\n\nPart IV: Central Plant - Cooling Systems (Chillers & Towers)\n\nCentral plants are the heavy artillery of HVAC. They are the largest energy consumers in large facilities (hospitals, large offices, campuses). Small efficiency gains here yield massive absolute savings.\n\n4.1 Chiller Audit Protocol\n\nA chiller makes cold water. It uses a vapor-compression cycle (or absorption) to remove heat from the water and reject it to the air (air-cooled) or to a cooling tower loop (water-cooled).\n\nModule 6: Chiller Plant Data Log\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nChiller Type\n\n☐ Air Cooled ☐ Water Cooled\n\n☐ Centrifugal ☐ Screw ☐ Scroll ☐ Reciprocating. Why: Centrifugal is efficient at full load; Screw/Scroll better at part load.\n\nRefrigerant Type\n\n____________________\n\nR-134a, R-410a, R-123, R-22 (Phase out). Important for replacement strategy and environmental compliance.26\n\nCapacity\n\n______ Tons\n\nCheck nameplate. 1 Ton = 12,000 BTU/hr.\n\nEntering CHW\n\n______ °F\n\nCHW: Chilled Water. Standard return temp is ~54°F.\n\nLeaving CHW\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard supply temp is ~44°F. A 10°F ΔT is design standard.\n\nEntering CW\n\n______ °F\n\nCW: Condenser Water (for water-cooled). Standard entering from tower is ~85°F (depends on wet bulb).\n\nLeaving CW\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard leaving to tower is ~95°F.\n\nCompressor Amps\n\nL1: __ L2: __ L3: __\n\nCompare to RLA (Rated Load Amps). Imbalance across phases indicates electrical issues.\n\nApproach Temp\n\n______ °F\n\nCritical Efficiency Metric. (Leaving Water Temp - Saturated Refrigerant Temp). See analysis below.\n\nNoise/Vibration\n\n☐ Smooth ☐ Grinding\n\nGrinding indicates bearing failure. High pitched whine might be \"surge\" (aerodynamic stall in centrifugal chillers).\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Sweating\n\nSweating evaporator barrel means insulation failure, gaining heat from the mechanical room.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Chiller Physics & Approach Temperature\n\nThe Approach Temperature is the most vital metric for diagnosing heat exchanger health in a chiller.\n\nEvaporator Approach: The difference between the Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and the Refrigerant Saturation Temperature in the evaporator.\n\nFormula: $T_{approach} = T_{leaving\\_water} - T_{refrigerant}$\n\nTarget: < 2°F to 3°F for modern chillers.\n\nImplication: If the approach is high (e.g., 8°F), it means heat is not transferring well from the water to the refrigerant. This is caused by scale/fouling on the tubes or low refrigerant charge. The compressor must work harder to lower the refrigerant temperature further to achieve the desired water temperature.27\n\nCondenser Approach: The difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and the Saturated Condensing Temperature.\n\nTarget: < 1°F to 4°F.\n\nImplication: High approach here means the chiller cannot get rid of its heat. This is almost always due to dirty tubes (mud/algae/scale from the cooling tower). Every 1°F increase in condenser temperature can increase compressor energy use by ~1.5%.29\n\nLift: The pressure difference between the evaporator and condenser. The compressor's job is to pump against this lift. Lowering the condenser water temperature (via cooling tower optimization) reduces lift and significantly drops energy usage.\n\n4.2 Cooling Tower Inspection\n\nThe cooling tower is the heat rejection device. It relies on evaporation to cool the condenser water. Its performance is tethered to the Wet Bulb Temperature of the ambient air.\n\nModule 7: Cooling Tower Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Visual Cues\n\nDraft Type\n\n☐ Induced ☐ Forced\n\nFan on top pulling air up (Induced) vs Fan on side blowing in (Forced).\n\nFill Condition\n\n☐ Clean ☐ Scaled/Clogged\n\n\"Fill\" is the honeycomb media inside. Scale buildup blocks air/water contact, destroying efficiency. 30\n\nWater Distribution\n\n☐ Uniform ☐ Dry Spots\n\nLook at the nozzles spraying water. Are parts of the fill dry? This reduces cooling capacity.\n\nFan Control\n\n☐ VFD ☐ On/Off ☐ 2-Speed\n\nVFD Opportunity: VFDs on tower fans offer massive savings by allowing the fan speed to float with the load and wet-bulb temperature.\n\nBleed/Blowdown\n\n☐ Auto ☐ Manual\n\nIs water constantly overflowing? Indicates float valve failure. Conductivity meter should control bleed to manage solids.\n\nDrift Eliminators\n\n☐ Intact ☐ Broken/Missing\n\nZig-zag slats that prevent water droplets from escaping. Saves water and chemicals.\n\nStructure\n\n☐ Good ☐ Corroded\n\nCheck for rust on metal towers or rot on wood towers.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Psychrometrics of Heat Rejection\n\nRange: The temperature difference between hot water entering the tower and cold water leaving (Standard ~10°F). $Range = T_{hot\\_in} - T_{cold\\_out}$.\n\nApproach: The difference between the cold water leaving the tower and the ambient Wet Bulb temperature. $Approach = T_{cold\\_out} - T_{wet\\_bulb}$.\n\nRule of Thumb: A tower cannot cool water below the wet bulb temperature. A \"good\" approach is 5°F to 7°F. If the wet bulb is 75°F, the best cold water temp you can theoretically get is ~80-82°F.\n\nAudit Check: If the local Wet Bulb is 70°F and the tower is supplying 85°F water, the approach is 15°F. This indicates poor performance—likely fouled fill, poor airflow, or bad water distribution.31\n\nCycles of Concentration: A measure of water efficiency. It compares the concentration of dissolved solids in the tower water vs. the makeup water. Higher cycles mean less water waste, but require better chemical treatment to prevent scale.\n\nVisual Cue: White scaling on the fill media acts as an insulator and blocks airflow. This forces the tower fan to run at 100% speed to try and maintain setpoint, wasting huge amounts of energy.30\n\nPart V: Central Plant - Heating Systems (Boilers & Steam)\n\nHeating systems are critical for comfort and process (sterilization, cooking), but are often oversized and inefficiently controlled.\n\n5.1 Boiler Audit Data\n\nBoilers come in two main flavors: Steam and Hot Water (Hydronic). Steam is common in older buildings and hospitals; Hot Water is common in modern offices.\n\nModule 8: Boiler System Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nType\n\n☐ Steam ☐ Hot Water\n\n☐ Fire Tube ☐ Water Tube ☐ Condensing ☐ Cast Iron.\n\nFuel Source\n\n☐ Nat. Gas ☐ Propane ☐ Oil\n\n☐ Electric.\n\nInput Capacity\n\n______ MBH\n\n1 Boiler HP ≈ 33,475 BTU/hr. Check nameplate.\n\nCombustion Analysis\n\nO2: __% CO: __ppm\n\nCritical: Must use combustion analyzer. See analysis below.\n\nStack Temp\n\n______ °F\n\nHigh stack temp = heat wasted up the chimney. (Net Stack Temp = Flue Temp - Room Temp).\n\nOperating Pressure/Temp\n\n___ psi / ___ °F\n\nIs it maintaining setpoint? Is the pressure relief valve leaking?\n\nCycles/Hour\n\n______\n\nFrequent on/off (<10 mins) = short cycling. Indicates oversizing or poor control bandwidth.\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Good ☐ Missing/Hot\n\nCheck boiler shell and piping. If you can't touch it (>140°F), it's losing energy to the room.\n\nSteam Traps\n\n☐ Functioning ☐ Blowing\n\nSteam Systems Only: Listen for hissing (blowing through). A failed open trap wastes thousands of dollars a year.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Combustion Efficiency & Stack Physics\n\nBoiler efficiency is determined by how well it burns fuel and transfers that heat to the water.\n\nExcess Air (O2): Combustion requires oxygen. For natural gas, we target ~3% to 5% O2 in the flue gas.\n\nToo High (>10%): We are bringing in too much cold air, heating it up, and sending it out the stack. This is a major efficiency loss.\n\nToo Low (<2%): Dangerous. Incomplete combustion occurs, creating Carbon Monoxide (CO) and soot (unburned fuel). This is a safety hazard.32\n\nStack Temperature: The flue gas must be hot enough to create draft and prevent condensation (unless it's a condensing boiler), but not too hot.\n\nRule of Thumb: Stack temp should be ~ambient + 300°F for standard boilers. If stack temp is 500°F+, the boiler tubes are likely sooted (fouled) on the fire side or scaled on the water side, insulating the water from the heat.33\n\nCondensing Boilers: These high-efficiency units (90%+) are designed to extract latent heat from water vapor in the flue gas. To do this, they must have low return water temperatures (<130°F) to cause condensation.\n\nAudit Check: If a facility has expensive condensing boilers but runs a standard 180°F supply / 160°F return loop, the boilers will not condense. They are operating at standard efficiency (80-82%), wasting the investment. This is a very common design/operation failure.34\n\n5.2 Domestic Hot Water (DHW)\n\nModule 9: DHW Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance\n\nSystem Type\n\n☐ Storage ☐ Tankless\n\n☐ Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH).\n\nTemp Setting\n\n______ °F\n\nStandard is 120°F (140°F for kitchens/hospitals). >140°F is scald hazard and energy waste.\n\nRecirculation Pump\n\n☐ Timer ☐ 24/7\n\n24/7 recirculation keeps pipes hot but wastes heat loss through the loop. A timer or aquastat is a simple ECM.\n\nInsulation\n\n☐ Pipe ☐ Tank\n\nFirst 5ft of pipe from tank must be insulated (heat trap). Tank wrap needed for older units.\n\nPart VI: Hydronics & Distribution (Pumps, Pipes, Valves)\n\nMoving energy (water/air) uses energy. Inefficient pumping can account for 20-30% of HVAC usage. We must assess if the pumps are fighting the system or working with it.\n\n6.1 Pump Audit\n\nModule 10: Pump Station Checklist\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance / Rationale\n\nApplication\n\n☐ CHW ☐ HW ☐ CW\n\nChilled, Hot, or Condenser Water.\n\nControl\n\n☐ VFD ☐ Constant Speed\n\nCheck if VFD is present but manually bypassed (running 60Hz).\n\nPressure Gauges\n\nSuction: __ Discharge: __\n\nCritical: Calculate Pump Head ($Head = (Discharge\\_psi - Suction\\_psi) \\times 2.31$). This validates the pump curve.\n\nValves (Triple Duty)\n\n☐ 100% Open ☐ Throttled\n\nMajor Waste: If the discharge valve is 50% closed (\"throttled\") to balance flow, it is like driving with the parking brake on. We are burning energy to overcome artificial resistance. Solution: Trim impeller or use VFD.\n\nNoise\n\n☐ Silent ☐ Gravel/Rocks\n\n\"Pumping rocks\" sound = Cavitation.\n\nSeal Condition\n\n☐ Dry ☐ Leaking\n\nWater on floor under coupler? Indicates mechanical seal failure.\n\nMotor\n\n______ HP / ______ RPM\n\nRecord nameplate data.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Pumping Dynamics & Cavitation\n\nCavitation: This occurs when pressure at the suction eye of the impeller falls below the water's vapor pressure. The water essentially \"boils\" at room temperature, creating vapor bubbles. When these bubbles move to the high-pressure discharge side, they implode violently.\n\nConsequences: Destroys impellers (pitting), destroys seals, creates noise, and reduces flow.\n\nVisual/Audio Cue: Sounds like marbles or gravel rattling in the pipe. Often caused by clogged suction strainers or poor system design (Net Positive Suction Head issue).35\n\nDeadhead Pressure: The pressure when the pump runs against a closed valve (zero flow). Measuring this and comparing it to the manufacturer's pump curve verifies if the impeller is worn or has been trimmed.\n\nThrottling: Using a valve to reduce flow consumes near-full pump energy while doing less work. This is a prime candidate for a VFD retrofit. The VFD allows you to open the valve and slow the pump down, saving energy according to the Affinity Laws (Power varies with the cube of speed).37\n\nPart VII: Building Automation & Controls (BMS)\n\nThe Building Management System (BMS) or Energy Management System (EMS) is the \"brain\" of the HVAC system. A confused brain wastes energy, no matter how efficient the \"muscles\" (equipment) are.\n\nModule 11: BMS / Controls Audit Checklist\n\n\n\nInspection Item\n\nObservation\n\nTechnical Guidance / \"The Why\"\n\nInterface\n\n☐ Modern GUI ☐ Legacy Text\n\nOlder systems may lack optimization logic (reset schedules, optimal start).\n\nOverrides\n\n______ % of points\n\nLook for \"Hand\" symbols, \"Operator\" priority, or forced values. Rule: If >10-20% of valves/fans are overridden \"Open,\" the auto-logic has failed. The system is manual.\n\nSchedules\n\n☐ Aligned ☐ 24/7\n\nDo schedules match actual occupancy? Check for \"temporary\" overrides left for years (e.g., \"Party Mode\" from 2019).\n\nSensor Calibration\n\n☐ Realistic ☐ Error\n\nE.g., Outside Air Temp reading 120°F in winter or 0°F in summer. Failed sensors cause economizers and reset schedules to malfunction completely.38\n\nSetpoints\n\nCool: __ Heat: __\n\nDeadband: Are heating/cooling setpoints too close (e.g., Heat to 70, Cool to 71)? This causes simultaneous heating and cooling (fighting), a massive waste. Target >4°F deadband.\n\nReset Schedules\n\n☐ Active ☐ Static\n\nDoes the hot water temp drop when it's warm outside? Does static pressure drop when VAVs close? Static setpoints waste energy.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Control Logic Failures\n\nSimultaneous Heating & Cooling: A classic waste found in VAV systems. One VAV box enters heating mode (reheat coil on), raising the return air temp. The central AHU sees this warm return air and ramps up cooling to compensate. The boiler and chiller effectively fight each other, and the utility meter spins.\n\nSensor Drift: Sensors drift over time. A CO2 sensor reading 2000ppm (when actual is 400ppm) will force outside air dampers open to 100%, causing huge heating/cooling loads. An outdoor air sensor reading 50°F when it is really 80°F will open the economizer, flooding the building with humid heat.\n\nOptimized Start/Stop: Does the system start at 6 AM fixed? Or does it calculate start time based on indoor/outdoor temp? \"Optimized Start\" can save hundreds of hours of run time per year.\n\nPart VIII: Specialized Environments (Server Rooms & Labs)\n\nThese areas have high energy density and critical requirements. They often override standard building controls.\n\nModule 12: Mission Critical Checklist\n\n\n\nField Name\n\nData Entry\n\nGuidance\n\nTemp Setpoint\n\n______ °F\n\nServers are often okay at 75-80°F (ASHRAE TC 9.9 guidelines). Many legacy server rooms cool to 65°F unnecessarily. Raising setpoints saves cooling energy.\n\nCRAC Units\n\n☐ Downflow ☐ Upflow\n\nComputer Room Air Conditioners. Check floor tiles.\n\nAirflow Management\n\n☐ Hot/Cold Aisle ☐ Chaotic\n\nAre perforated tiles located only in cold aisles (front of servers)? Are there blanks in the racks?\n\nCable Management\n\n☐ Tidy ☐ Blocked\n\nCables blocking rear rack exhaust cause hot spots, forcing server fans to run at 100% RPM.39\n\nRedundancy\n\nN+1 present?\n\nEnsure backup cooling doesn't mean running all units at 100% capacity simultaneously. They should stage or run at part-load.\n\nPart IX: Advanced Diagnostics & IoT Integration\n\nModern auditing can be augmented by the temporary installation of IoT sensors to capture data over time (1-2 weeks), rather than just a snapshot.\n\n9.1 IoT Data Logging Strategy\n\nCurrent Transducers (CTs): Clip onto motor leads to log amperage. This reveals the load profile. Is the motor running 24/7? Is it variable or constant?.40\n\nTemp/Humidity Loggers: Place in spaces to verify thermostat accuracy and comfort. Place in supply/return ducts to verify ΔT and economizer operation over a week.\n\nVibration Sensors: Magnetic sensors on pumps/motors. increasing vibration trends predict bearing failure or cavitation before it becomes audible.41\n\n9.2 Field Rules of Thumb for Auditors\n\nUse these to sanity-check your findings in real-time.\n\nCooling Load: ~400-500 sq. ft. per Ton for average offices. If a 2,000 sq. ft. office has a 10-ton unit (200 sq. ft./ton), it is grossly oversized.42\n\nAirflow: ~400 CFM per Ton of cooling.\n\nChiller Flow: ~2.4 GPM per Ton for Chilled Water; ~3.0 GPM per Ton for Condenser Water.42\n\nMotor Amps: Full load amps (FLA) roughly equals Horsepower × 1.2 (for 460V 3-phase). If a 10HP motor is drawing 2 amps, it's doing no work (broken belt/coupling).\n\n9.3 Visual Deficiencies Guide\n\nSoot on Boiler Vent: Incomplete combustion / lack of air / clogged burner.\n\nIce on DX Coil: Low airflow, dirty filter, or low refrigerant charge.\n\nOil Stains on Piping: Refrigerant leak location.\n\nDimming Lights on Start-up: Compressor \"Hard Start\"—electrical issues, bad capacitor, or locked rotor.43\n\nPart X: Post-Audit Analysis & Reporting\n\nThe value of the audit is in the translation of field data into actionable ECMs. The data collected in Modules 1-12 feeds directly into the engineering calculations.\n\nModule 13: Analysis Preparation\n\nData Point Collected\n\nECM Opportunity\n\nCalculation Methodology\n\nStuck Economizer\n\nAirside Economizer Repair\n\nBin analysis using local weather data to calculate hours of free cooling lost.\n\nConstant Volume Fan\n\nVFD Retrofit\n\nFan Laws: Power varies with the cube of speed ($P_2 = P_1 \\times (N_2/N_1)^3$). 20% speed reduction = 50% energy savings.\n\nHigh Discharge Pressure\n\nPump Impeller Trimming\n\nPump Laws. Analyze pump curve vs system curve to find new operating point.\n\nLighting Schedule\n\nBMS Scheduling\n\nSimple runtime reduction (kW × hours saved).\n\nLow Delta T\n\nCoil Cleaning / Valve Repair\n\nIncreases chiller efficiency and reduces pump energy.\n\n10.1 Required Documentation for Engineering Handoff\n\nTo close the audit loop, ensure the following are collected before leaving the site:\n\n[ ] 12-36 months of utility bills (Electric, Gas, Water).10\n\n[ ] Mechanical schedules (As-built drawings) - scan or photo.\n\n[ ] TAB (Test, Adjust, Balance) reports (provides design airflow baselines).\n\n[ ] Photos of every nameplate and every visual deficiency (macro and wide shots).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis framework provides EverWatt with a structured, rigorous methodology for conducting HVAC audits. By moving beyond a simple \"inventory\" to a \"diagnostic assessment,\" EverWatt positions itself to identify deeper, more lucrative energy savings for clients. The integration of visual inspection, tool-based measurement, and control-logic review ensures that the final Scope of Work is engineered based on reality, not assumptions. Use the Modules provided as the standard field templates for all future engagements.\n\nWorks cited\n\nHVAC Compliance & Safety Standards: Essential Guide for U.S. Field Service Businesses, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.fieldax.com/blog/hvac-compliance-safety-standards-us-guide/\n\nASHRAE Standards and Guidelines, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/ashrae-standards-and-guidelines\n\nTop HVAC Quality Assurance Tips and Strategies for 2025 - ServiceTitan, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/hvac-quality-assurance\n\nThermographic Inspections - Department of Energy, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermographic-inspections\n\nThermal Imaging for Energy Auditing & Building Inspection - Flir, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.flir.com/instruments/energy-audit/\n\nCombustion Analysis - Gerard Home Inspection, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.gerardhomeinspection.com/combustion-analysis\n\nCombustion Analysis: Readings, Ratings, & Results - Raeco Rents, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.raecorents.com/blog/how-to-do-combustion-anaysis\n\naccessed December 10, 2025, https://tsi.com/hvac-consultant/learn/why-accurate-duct-static-pressure-measurement-is-critical-for-hvac-efficiency#:~:text=It's%20a%20measure%20of%20how,design%20or%20improperly%20sized%20components.\n\nStatic Pressure in HVAC Systems - Lennox, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.lennox.com/residential/buyers-guide/guide-to-hvac/glossary/what-is-static-pressure-in-hvac\n\nEverWatt_HVAC_PreAssessment_TrainingVersion_(Checklist).docx\n\nChecklists of Energy-Saving Measures, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/save-energy-commercial-buildings/ways-save/checklists\n\nASHRAE Level 2 energy audit checklist template - Lumiform, accessed December 10, 2025, https://lumiformapp.com/templates/ashrae-level-2-energy-audit-checklist_35438\n\nEnergy Audit Checklist: Essential Steps for a Comprehensive Energy Assessment - Performance Validation, accessed December 10, 2025, https://perfval.com/energy-audit-checklist/\n\nDo-It-Yourself Home Energy Assessments, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/do-it-yourself-home-energy-assessments\n\n10 Essential RTU Tune-up Checklist - High Efficiency Cooling & Heating Inc., accessed December 10, 2025, https://highefficiencyinc.com/10-essential-rtu-tune-up-checklist/\n\nField Economizer Retrofit Guide - kele.com, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.kele.com/content/blog/field-economizer-retrofit-guide\n\nEconomizers in Air Handling Systems - CED Engineering, accessed December 10, 2025, https://www.cedengineering.com/userfiles/M02-014%20-%20Economizers%20in%20Air%20Handling%20Systems%20-%20US.pdf\n\nEconomizer Basics: Who Uses Them, Where They're Required, and Why They Wind Up in Claims - Alpine Intel, accessed December 10, 2025, https://alpineintel.com/resource/economizer-basics-who-uses-them-where-theyre-required-and-why-they-wind-up-in-claims/\n\nWhat is AC Short Cycling, and How Can It Harm Your Unit?, accessed December 10, 2025, https://qualtechachtg.com/what-is-ac-short-cycling/\n\nAC Compressor Short Cycling: Diagnosing Rapid On/Off Cycles During Summer Heat, accessed December 10, 2025, https://energy-one.com/central-air-conditioner-short-cycling-diagnosis-summer-heat/\n\nESL AIR HANDLING UNITS AIR HANDLER START-UP CHECKLIST - Johnson Controls, accessed December 10, 2025, https://webselect.johnsoncontrols.com/Products-ESL/Docs/ESLStart-upChecklist.pdf\n\nMERV Air Filter Pressure Drop Chart - Filterbuy.com, accessed December 10, 2025, https://filterbuy.com/resources/air-filter-basics/merv-air-filter-pressure-drop-chart/\n\nWhat is static pressure and how does static pressure affect the performance of an HVAC system?
