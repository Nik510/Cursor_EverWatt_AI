        "heading": "Executive Summary",
        "content": "The optimization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represents the single most significant opportunity for operational cost reduction and decarbonization in commercial and industrial facilities. However, the efficacy of any energy conservation measure (ECM) is fundamentally limited by the quality of the initial data upon which it is based. For EverWatt to deliver superior engineering audits that transcend simple equipment inventories, the field data collection process must evolve into a rigorous diagnostic investigation. This report establishes a standardized, exhaustive protocol for EverWatt’s HVAC audit teams, designed to bridge the gap between initial site walkthroughs and complex engineering modeling.\n\nThis framework moves beyond merely identifying what equipment is present to understanding how it operates, why it consumes energy at its current rate, and where the thermodynamic inefficiencies lie. We are not just counting units; we are profiling the metabolic rate of the building. This document is structured into distinct \"Data Collection Modules,\" each providing a field-ready checklist template embedded within a deep-dive technical analysis. This structure ensures that every data point collected has a clear engineering purpose, whether it is to calibrate a load simulation, justify a capital expenditure, or identify an immediate low-cost operational improvement. By strictly adhering to these protocols, EverWatt mitigates the risk of modeling errors, reduces the necessity for costly return site visits, and uncovers high-value savings opportunities that surface-level assessments routinely miss."

        "content": "Before a single piece of equipment is inspected, the foundational elements of safety, access, and diagnostic capability must be established. An HVAC audit involves interaction with high-voltage electrical systems, high-pressure steam and refrigerant vessels, rotating machinery, and potentially hazardous chemical environments. The auditor’s preparedness directly correlates to the depth and safety of the audit.\n\n1.1 Field Safety Protocols and Risk Assessment\n\nThe safety of the EverWatt team is paramount. HVAC environments are dynamic and often hazardous. Auditors must navigate mechanical rooms that may have been neglected for years, presenting risks ranging from biological hazards in cooling towers to electrical arc flash potential in control panels."

        "heading": "Technical Rationale: Operational Safety & Liability",
        "content": "The operational environment of a mechanical plant is unforgiving. For instance, cooling towers are notorious breeding grounds for Legionella pneumophila if water treatment programs fail. An auditor breathing in mist from a poorly maintained tower puts themselves at risk. Similarly, high-pressure steam leaks in boiler rooms can be invisible (\"dry steam\") and capable of cutting through protective clothing instantly. The checklists provided here are not merely bureaucratic hurdles; they are life-safety requirements. Furthermore, understanding the safety status of a facility provides immediate insight into the quality of maintenance. A mechanical room littered with debris, bypassed safety switches, or missing belt guards is a leading indicator of deferred maintenance, suggesting that the HVAC equipment itself is likely operating far below its design efficiency.1\n\n1.2 Essential Diagnostic Tools for the Auditor\n\nTo move beyond a visual inspection (\"The unit is there\") to a diagnostic inspection (\"The unit is failing\"), EverWatt auditors must deploy specific diagnostic tools. The \"eyeball test\" is insufficient for energy engineering. We need quantitative data to build our baselines.\n\nInfrared (Thermal) Camera: This is indispensable for non-contact diagnostics. It allows the auditor to see temperature differentials that indicate failure.\n\nApplication: Detecting insulation voids in the building envelope, identifying overheating electrical breakers (indicating high resistance/loose connections), verifying coil performance (uniform temperature distribution vs. blocked circuits), and spotting steam trap failures (trap is hot on both sides, indicating blow-through).4\n\nCombustion Analyzer: Required for any boiler audit. A blue flame does not guarantee efficiency. We need to measure Oxygen (O2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and net stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency and excess air.6\n\nAnemometer / Manometer: These measure airflow velocity and static pressure. High static pressure drops across filters or coils indicate flow restrictions that exponentially increase fan energy consumption. The manometer is the \"blood pressure cuff\" of the airside system.8\n\nUltrasonic Flow Meter: A non-invasive method to measure fluid flow (GPM) in chilled water or hot water loops without cutting pipes. This verifies if pumps are oversized or if flow is being throttled.\n\nPower Logger / Clamp Meter: For spot-checking instantaneous voltage and amperage of motors to compare against nameplate ratings. This validates the actual load factor of the equipment.\n\nPsychrometer: Measures dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, allowing for the calculation of relative humidity and enthalpy. This is critical for assessing cooling tower performance and economizer operation."

        "heading": "Part II: Facility Operation & Building Envelope Assessment",
        "content": "The HVAC system does not exist in a vacuum; it is a reactive system designed to counteract the thermal loads imposed by the building envelope and internal processes. Therefore, the audit must begin with a thorough characterization of the building itself. If we do not understand the building's physics and operation, we cannot model the baseline energy usage accurately.\n\n2.1 Facility Operation Profile\n\nThe operational profile defines the \"when\" and \"how much\" of energy consumption. A primary error in energy auditing is assuming standard operating hours (e.g., 9-5) for facilities that may have cleaning crews at night, weekend shifts, or critical loads running 24/7."

        "heading": "Technical Analysis: Load Profiling and Operational Dynamics",
        "content": "Understanding the \"Why\" behind these fields is crucial for the auditor.\n\nLoad Decoupling: We must separate weather-dependent loads (conduction through walls, solar gain) from base loads (lighting, servers, process equipment). A data center operates 8,760 hours a year with a massive cooling load even when it is -20°F outside due to server heat. Conversely, a school operates ~2,000 hours a year and its load is dominated by the need to heat/cool fresh air for students. Confusing these profiles leads to disastrously inaccurate energy models.\n\nScheduling Opportunities: The simplest, highest-ROI ECM is often scheduling. If a building operates 24/7 but only needs strict temperature control from 8 AM to 6 PM, implementing temperature setbacks during unoccupied hours can save 10-20% of HVAC energy immediately without buying new equipment. The auditor must ask: \"Why is this running right now?\".11\n\nUtility Rate Impact: The \"Electric Rate Schedule\" 10 dictates the financial viability of projects. If a client pays high demand charges ($/kW), thermal storage or load-shedding strategies become viable. If they pay flat rates, efficiency (kWh reduction) is the priority.\n\n2.2 Building Envelope Inspection\n\nThe envelope (walls, roof, windows, foundation) acts as the barrier to heat flow. An HVAC system is simply a machine designed to counteract the failure of the envelope to maintain interior conditions. A leaky bucket requires the tap to run constantly; sealing the bucket (the envelope) allows us to turn down the tap (the HVAC)."

        "content": "Infiltration (Air Leakage): Uncontrolled air leakage forces the HVAC system to condition outside air that hasn't passed through a dedicated intake or energy recovery unit. This is the most expensive air to treat because it enters at extreme temperatures. The auditor should look for \"cobwebs moving\" near corners or verify if the building is positively pressurized (doors push open) or negatively pressurized (doors suck shut). Negative pressure sucks in unconditioned air, causing humidity problems and drafts.13\n\nSolar Heat Gain: In commercial buildings with high glass-to-wall ratios, solar gain is often the dominant cooling load. Auditors should note the orientation of glass. West-facing glass causes late-afternoon peak loads that align with peak utility pricing. Tinting or shading these windows is a prime ECM.\n\nInsulation Integrity: It is not enough to know if there is insulation; we must know its condition. Compressed fiberglass loses its R-value. Wet roof insulation not only loses thermal resistance but can destroy the roof deck. The thermal camera is the tool of choice here, revealing cold/hot spots that the naked eye misses.4"

        "content": "Economizer Diagnostics: The economizer is a damper system that brings in cool outside air to cool the building without running the compressor (\"free cooling\"). It is the first component to fail and often goes unnoticed.\n\nStuck Open: If stuck open in summer, the unit pulls in 95°F/90% humidity air, overwhelming the coil and causing humidity issues and high energy bills.\n\nStuck Closed: If stuck closed in winter/spring (e.g., 55°F outside), the unit must run mechanical compressors to cool the core of the building, wasting free cooling potential.\n\nAudit Action: The auditor must physically inspect the damper linkage. If it is zip-tied shut or the actuator is hanging loose, mark it as \"Failed\".17\n\nShort Cycling: If a compressor runs for 3 minutes and shuts off, then restarts 2 minutes later, it is \"short cycling.\" This destroys the compressor (due to heat buildup in windings) and ruins efficiency (SEER) because the system never reaches steady-state operation. It indicates oversizing, low refrigerant charge (safety switch tripping), or a blocked coil.19\n\nCondenser Coils: The condenser rejects heat to the outdoors. If the coil is plugged with dirt (\"sweater\"), the refrigerant cannot condense properly. The pressure rises (head pressure), forcing the compressor to work harder and draw more amps. A 10% reduction in airflow can degrade efficiency by 5-10% and capacity by even more.15\n\n3.2 Air Handling Unit (AHU) Deep Dive\n\nAHUs are generally larger, indoor units that may be connected to a central plant (chillers/boilers) or have their own DX (Direct Expansion) cooling. They serve larger zones and have more complex controls."

Causes include dirty filters, crushed ducts, or fire dampers that have slammed shut.\n\nLow Static: Indicates the fan is spinning but not building pressure—likely a broken belt or a large disconnect in the supply duct.9\n\nLow Delta T Syndrome: In a chilled water system, the water is the transport medium for heat. If water enters the coil at 44°F and leaves at 46°F (ΔT = 2°F), the water is moving too fast through the coil to pick up heat (laminar flow issues or fouled coil). This forces the central plant pumps to pump massive amounts of water to do very little cooling work. It also wreaks havoc on chiller efficiency.24\n\nFilter Pressure Drop: As filters load with dirt, the pressure drop across them increases. In a system with a VFD, the fan speeds up to compensate, using more energy. In a constant volume system, airflow decreases, reducing cooling capacity. Modern \"high efficiency\" filters (MERV 13+) have higher initial pressure drops; the system must be designed to handle this penalty.25"

The compressor must work harder to lower the refrigerant temperature further to achieve the desired water temperature.27\n\nCondenser Approach: The difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and the Saturated Condensing Temperature.\n\nTarget: < 1°F to 4°F.\n\nImplication: High approach here means the chiller cannot get rid of its heat.

For natural gas, we target ~3% to 5% O2 in the flue gas.\n\nToo High (>10%): We are bringing in too much cold air, heating it up, and sending it out the stack. This is a major efficiency loss.\n\nToo Low (<2%): Dangerous. Incomplete combustion occurs, creating Carbon Monoxide (CO) and soot (unburned fuel). This is a safety hazard.32\n\nStack Temperature: The flue gas must be hot enough to create draft and prevent condensation (unless it's a condensing boiler), but not too hot.\n\nRule of Thumb: Stack temp should be ~ambient + 300°F for standard boilers. If stack temp is 500°F+, the boiler tubes are likely sooted (fouled) on the fire side or scaled on the water side, insulating the water from the heat.33\n\nCondensing Boilers: These high-efficiency units (90%+) are designed to extract latent heat from water vapor in the flue gas. To do this, they must have low return water temperatures (<130°F) to cause condensation.\n\nAudit Check: If a facility has expensive condensing boilers but runs a standard 180°F supply / 160°F return loop, the boilers will not condense. They are operating at standard efficiency (80-82%), wasting the investment. This is a very common design/operation failure.34\n\n5.2 Domestic Hot Water (DHW)"

When these bubbles move to the high-pressure discharge side, they implode violently.\n\nConsequences: Destroys impellers (pitting), destroys seals, creates noise, and reduces flow.\n\nVisual/Audio Cue: Sounds like marbles or gravel rattling in the pipe. Often caused by clogged suction strainers or poor system design (Net Positive Suction Head issue).35\n\nDeadhead Pressure: The pressure when the pump runs against a closed valve (zero flow). Measuring this and comparing it to the manufacturer's pump curve verifies if the impeller is worn or has been trimmed.\n\nThrottling: Using a valve to reduce flow consumes near-full pump energy while doing less work. This is a prime candidate for a VFD retrofit. The VFD allows you to open the valve and slow the pump down, saving energy according to the Affinity Laws (Power varies with the cube of speed).37"

        "content": "The optimization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represents the single most significant opportunity for operational cost reduction and decarbonization in commercial and industrial facilities. However, the efficacy of any energy conservation measure (ECM) is fundamentally limited by the quality of the initial data upon which it is based. For EverWatt to deliver superior engineering audits that transcend simple equipment inventories, the field data collection process must evolve into a rigorous diagnostic investigation. This report establishes a standardized, exhaustive protocol for EverWatt’s HVAC audit teams, designed to bridge the gap between initial site walkthroughs and complex engineering modeling.\n\nThis framework moves beyond merely identifying what equipment is present to understanding how it operates, why it consumes energy at its current rate, and where the thermodynamic inefficiencies lie. We are not just counting units; we are profiling the metabolic rate of the building. This document is structured into distinct \"Data Collection Modules,\" each providing a field-ready checklist template embedded within a deep-dive technical analysis. This structure ensures that every data point collected has a clear engineering purpose, whether it is to calibrate a load simulation, justify a capital expenditure, or identify an immediate low-cost operational improvement. By strictly adhering to these protocols, EverWatt mitigates the risk of modeling errors, reduces the necessity for costly return site visits, and uncovers high-value savings opportunities that surface-level assessments routinely miss."

An HVAC audit involves interaction with high-voltage electrical systems, high-pressure steam and refrigerant vessels, rotating machinery, and potentially hazardous chemical environments. The auditor’s preparedness directly correlates to the depth and safety of the audit.\n\n1.1 Field Safety Protocols and Risk Assessment\n\nThe safety of the EverWatt team is paramount. HVAC environments are dynamic and often hazardous. Auditors must navigate mechanical rooms that may have been neglected for years, presenting risks ranging from biological hazards in cooling towers to electrical arc flash potential in control panels."

      {
        "heading": "Technical Rationale: Operational Safety & Liability",
        "content": "The operational environment of a mechanical plant is unforgiving. For instance, cooling towers are notorious breeding grounds for Legionella pneumophila if water treatment programs fail. An auditor breathing in mist from a poorly maintained tower puts themselves at risk. Similarly, high-pressure steam leaks in boiler rooms can be invisible (\"dry steam\") and capable of cutting through protective clothing instantly. The checklists provided here are not merely bureaucratic hurdles; they are life-safety requirements. Furthermore, understanding the safety status of a facility provides immediate insight into the quality of maintenance. A mechanical room littered with debris, bypassed safety switches, or missing belt guards is a leading indicator of deferred maintenance, suggesting that the HVAC equipment itself is likely operating far below its design efficiency.1\n\n1.2 Essential Diagnostic Tools for the Auditor\n\nTo move beyond a visual inspection (\"The unit is there\") to a diagnostic inspection (\"The unit is failing\"), EverWatt auditors must deploy specific diagnostic tools. The \"eyeball test\" is insufficient for energy engineering. We need quantitative data to build our baselines.\n\nInfrared (Thermal) Camera: This is indispensable for non-contact diagnostics. It allows the auditor to see temperature differentials that indicate failure.\n\nApplication: Detecting insulation voids in the building envelope, identifying overheating electrical breakers (indicating high resistance/loose connections), verifying coil performance (uniform temperature distribution vs. blocked circuits), and spotting steam trap failures (trap is hot on both sides, indicating blow-through).4\n\nCombustion Analyzer: Required for any boiler audit. A blue flame does not guarantee efficiency. We need to measure Oxygen (O2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and net stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency and excess air.6\n\nAnemometer / Manometer: These measure airflow velocity and static pressure. High static pressure drops across filters or coils indicate flow restrictions that exponentially increase fan energy consumption. The manometer is the \"blood pressure cuff\" of the airside system.8\n\nUltrasonic Flow Meter: A non-invasive method to measure fluid flow (GPM) in chilled water or hot water loops without cutting pipes. This verifies if pumps are oversized or if flow is being throttled.\n\nPower Logger / Clamp Meter: For spot-checking instantaneous voltage and amperage of motors to compare against nameplate ratings. This validates the actual load factor of the equipment.\n\nPsychrometer: Measures dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, allowing for the calculation of relative humidity and enthalpy. This is critical for assessing cooling tower performance and economizer operation."

        "heading": "Part II: Facility Operation & Building Envelope Assessment",
        "content": "The HVAC system does not exist in a vacuum; it is a reactive system designed to counteract the thermal loads imposed by the building envelope and internal processes. Therefore, the audit must begin with a thorough characterization of the building itself. If we do not understand the building's physics and operation, we cannot model the baseline energy usage accurately.\n\n2.1 Facility Operation Profile\n\nThe operational profile defines the \"when\" and \"how much\" of energy consumption. A primary error in energy auditing is assuming standard operating hours (e.g., 9-5) for facilities that may have cleaning crews at night, weekend shifts, or critical loads running 24/7."

      {
        "heading": "Technical Analysis: Load Profiling and Operational Dynamics",
        "content": "Understanding the \"Why\" behind these fields is crucial for the auditor.\n\nLoad Decoupling: We must separate weather-dependent loads (conduction through walls, solar gain) from base loads (lighting, servers, process equipment). A data center operates 8,760 hours a year with a massive cooling load even when it is -20°F outside due to server heat. Conversely, a school operates ~2,000 hours a year and its load is dominated by the need to heat/cool fresh air for students. Confusing these profiles leads to disastrously inaccurate energy models.\n\nScheduling Opportunities: The simplest, highest-ROI ECM is often scheduling. If a building operates 24/7 but only needs strict temperature control from 8 AM to 6 PM, implementing temperature setbacks during unoccupied hours can save 10-20% of HVAC energy immediately without buying new equipment. The auditor must ask: \"Why is this running right now?\".11\n\nUtility Rate Impact: The \"Electric Rate Schedule\" 10 dictates the financial viability of projects. If a client pays high demand charges ($/kW), thermal storage or load-shedding strategies become viable. If they pay flat rates, efficiency (kWh reduction) is the priority.\n\n2.2 Building Envelope Inspection\n\nThe envelope (walls, roof, windows, foundation) acts as the barrier to heat flow. An HVAC system is simply a machine designed to counteract the failure of the envelope to maintain interior conditions. A leaky bucket requires the tap to run constantly; sealing the bucket (the envelope) allows us to turn down the tap (the HVAC)."

        "content": "Infiltration (Air Leakage): Uncontrolled air leakage forces the HVAC system to condition outside air that hasn't passed through a dedicated intake or energy recovery unit. This is the most expensive air to treat because it enters at extreme temperatures. The auditor should look for \"cobwebs moving\" near corners or verify if the building is positively pressurized (doors push open) or negatively pressurized (doors suck shut). Negative pressure sucks in unconditioned air, causing humidity problems and drafts.13\n\nSolar Heat Gain: In commercial buildings with high glass-to-wall ratios, solar gain is often the dominant cooling load. Auditors should note the orientation of glass. West-facing glass causes late-afternoon peak loads that align with peak utility pricing. Tinting or shading these windows is a prime ECM.\n\nInsulation Integrity: It is not enough to know if there is insulation; we must know its condition. Compressed fiberglass loses its R-value. Wet roof insulation not only loses thermal resistance but can destroy the roof deck. The thermal camera is the tool of choice here, revealing cold/hot spots that the naked eye misses.4"

It is the first component to fail and often goes unnoticed.\n\nStuck Open: If stuck open in summer, the unit pulls in 95°F/90% humidity air, overwhelming the coil and causing humidity issues and high energy bills.\n\nStuck Closed: If stuck closed in winter/spring (e.g., 55°F outside), the unit must run mechanical compressors to cool the core of the building, wasting free cooling potential.\n\nAudit Action: The auditor must physically inspect the damper linkage. If it is zip-tied shut or the actuator is hanging loose, mark it as \"Failed\".17\n\nShort Cycling: If a compressor runs for 3 minutes and shuts off, then restarts 2 minutes later, it is \"short cycling.\" This destroys the compressor (due to heat buildup in windings) and ruins efficiency (SEER) because the system never reaches steady-state operation. It indicates oversizing, low refrigerant charge (safety switch tripping), or a blocked coil.19\n\nCondenser Coils: The condenser rejects heat to the outdoors. If the coil is plugged with dirt (\"sweater\"), the refrigerant cannot condense properly. The pressure rises (head pressure), forcing the compressor to work harder and draw more amps. A 10% reduction in airflow can degrade efficiency by 5-10% and capacity by even more.15\n\n3.2 Air Handling Unit (AHU) Deep Dive\n\nAHUs are generally larger, indoor units that may be connected to a central plant (chillers/boilers) or have their own DX (Direct Expansion) cooling. They serve larger zones and have more complex controls."

Causes include dirty filters, crushed ducts, or fire dampers that have slammed shut.\n\nLow Static: Indicates the fan is spinning but not building pressure—likely a broken belt or a large disconnect in the supply duct.9\n\nLow Delta T Syndrome: In a chilled water system, the water is the transport medium for heat. If water enters the coil at 44°F and leaves at 46°F (ΔT = 2°F), the water is moving too fast through the coil to pick up heat (laminar flow issues or fouled coil). This forces the central plant pumps to pump massive amounts of water to do very little cooling work. It also wreaks havoc on chiller efficiency.24\n\nFilter Pressure Drop: As filters load with dirt, the pressure drop across them increases. In a system with a VFD, the fan speeds up to compensate, using more energy. In a constant volume system, airflow decreases, reducing cooling capacity. Modern \"high efficiency\" filters (MERV 13+) have higher initial pressure drops; the system must be designed to handle this penalty.25"

This is a major efficiency loss.\n\nToo Low (<2%): Dangerous. Incomplete combustion occurs, creating Carbon Monoxide (CO) and soot (unburned fuel). This is a safety hazard.32\n\nStack Temperature: The flue gas must be hot enough to create draft and prevent condensation (unless it's a condensing boiler), but not too hot.\n\nRule of Thumb: Stack temp should be ~ambient + 300°F for standard boilers. If stack temp is 500°F+, the boiler tubes are likely sooted (fouled) on the fire side or scaled on the water side, insulating the water from the heat.33\n\nCondensing Boilers: These high-efficiency units (90%+) are designed to extract latent heat from water vapor in the flue gas.

If the errors are randomly distributed around zero (unbiased), the sum tends toward zero, resulting in a low NMBE. If the model consistently overpredicts or underpredicts, NMBE grows.\n\nThresholds: To be compliant with ASHRAE Guideline 14, the AI model must achieve an NMBE of ±5% when calibrated to monthly utility billing data, or ±10% when calibrated to hourly interval data.1\n\nOptimization Strategy: The AI's loss function must include a regularization term that heavily penalizes non-zero summation of residuals, ensuring that the integral of the prediction matches the integral of the history.\n\n2.1.2 Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE)\n\nWhile NMBE measures bias, CV-RMSE measures precision—the scatter of the data points around the regression line. It represents the model's ability to capture the dynamic response of the building to changing independent variables like weather or occupancy.\n\nThe governing equation for CV-RMSE is:\n\n$$\\text{CV(RMSE)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=1} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{n - p}}}{\\bar{y}} \\times 100$$"

        "content": "The numerator essentially calculates the standard deviation of the residuals. A high CV-RMSE indicates that the model is failing to explain the variance in the energy data. This typically signals that a critical independent variable (driver) is missing from the AI's input features.\n\nThresholds: ASHRAE Guideline 14 requires a CV-RMSE of less than 15% for monthly data and less than 30% for hourly data.2\n\nFeature Engineering Trigger: If the AI trains a model using only Outside Air Temperature (OAT) and the resulting CV-RMSE exceeds 30%, the system logic must trigger a search for additional variables. Common missing drivers include Occupancy Schedules (time-of-day binary variables), Production Rates (for industrial facilities), or Humidity (enthalpy effects). The gap between the 15% monthly allowance and the 30% hourly allowance acknowledges the inherent noise in high-frequency data, such as the random behavior of occupants or short-term thermal mass effects.3\n\n2.2 Regression Methodologies and Change-Point Detection\n\nASHRAE Guideline 14 identifies specific regression structures that best approximate building thermal performance. The AI model should not blindly apply deep learning techniques (like LSTMs) without first establishing a baseline using these interpretable physical regression models.\n\n2.2.1 Change-Point Models (3P, 4P, 5P)\n\nBuilding energy use is rarely linear across the entire temperature spectrum. It typically exhibits distinct regimes: a \"deadband\" where energy use is driven by baseloads (lighting, plug loads) and not weather, and \"heating/cooling slopes\" where energy use increases linearly with temperature deviation. The AI must be capable of fitting Change-Point Models.4\n\nThree-Parameter (3P) Model: Appropriate for buildings with only heating or only cooling dependency.\n\nEquation: $E = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2(T - \\beta_3)^+$\n\n$\\beta_1$: Baseload energy consumption.\n\n$\\beta_2$: Slope of the weather-dependent curve (UA value proxy).\n\n$\\beta_3$: Change-point temperature (balance point).\n\nFour-Parameter (4P) Model: Used when there is a distinct heating slope and a distinct cooling slope, but they meet at a single change point (common in heat pump applications).\n\nFive-Parameter (5P) Model: The most robust model for commercial buildings with simultaneous heating and cooling capabilities. It defines a deadband between two distinct change points.\n\nEquation: $E = C + B_1(\\beta_{heat} - T)^+ + B_2(T - \\beta_{cool})^+$\n\nThis model captures the behavior of VAV systems with reheat, where energy use is high in winter, drops in the swing season deadband, and rises again in summer.\n\n2.2.2 Non-Routine Adjustments (NRA) and Categorical Variables\n\nA major challenge in energy modeling is the \"Non-Routine Event\" (NRE)—a structural change in the facility that renders the baseline invalid. Examples include the addition of a new wing, a change in shift schedules (e.g., going from 1 shift to 2 shifts), or significant occupancy changes (e.g., COVID-19).\n\nASHRAE Guideline 14 and the IPMVP protocols mandate Non-Routine Adjustments (NRA) using categorical (dummy) variables. The AI model must detect these shifts and adjust the regression equation accordingly."

      {
        "heading": "Where:",
        "content": "$I_{event}$ is a binary variable (0 for the pre-event period, 1 for the post-event period).\n\n$D_1$ represents the fixed shift in energy consumption (intercept shift) attributable to the event.\n\nAI Detection Logic:\n\nThe AI should continuously monitor the Cumulative Sum of Residuals (CUSUM). If the CUSUM graph deviates significantly from zero (a \"knee\" in the curve), it indicates a permanent shift in the system. The AI then introduces a dummy variable at the timestamp of the deviation. If re-running the regression with this dummy variable significantly reduces the CV-RMSE (improving the fit), the event is confirmed as a valid NRE, and the coefficient $D_1$ quantifies the energy impact of that change (e.g., \"The new server room added 50 kW to the baseload\").5\n\n3. Verification Frameworks: IPMVP Protocols\n\nWhile ASHRAE Guideline 14 provides the mathematical engine, the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) provides the contractual framework. The AI model must categorize its analysis into one of the four IPMVP Options to ensure that the reported savings are compliant with performance contracts and utility rebate requirements.\n\n3.1 Option C: Whole Facility Verification\n\nThis is the primary mode for an AI model ingesting utility bill data.\n\nMethodology: Regression analysis of whole-building meter data against independent variables (weather, occupancy).\n\nThreshold for Applicability: Option C is generally recommended only when the expected savings exceed 10% of the total facility energy use. If savings are smaller, they may be lost in the statistical noise (uncertainty) of the regression.\n\nAI Implementation: The model calculates the \"Avoided Energy Use\":$$ \\text{Savings} = \\text{Energy}{\\text{Baseline Model}}(\\text{Current Conditions}) - \\text{Energy}{\\text{Measured}} $$The AI must generate a baseline model using historical data (Training Period) and then project that model into the reporting period using current weather data.7\n\n3.2 Option D: Calibrated Simulation\n\nThis option is necessary when no historical baseline exists (e.g., new construction or major renovation) or when isolating a specific retrofit is impossible via metering.\n\nMethodology: The AI creates a physics-based simulation (Digital Twin) using engines like EnergyPlus or DOE-2.\n\nCalibration: The simulation inputs (schedules, U-values, efficiencies) are iteratively adjusted until the simulation's output matches the actual utility bills.\n\nAI Implementation: This requires an optimization loop (e.g., genetic algorithms) where the AI tweaks thousands of parameters to minimize the CV-RMSE between the simulation and the meter. Once calibrated, the AI can simulate \"What-If\" scenarios—removing specific ECMs to calculate savings.8\n\n3.3 Option A & B: Retrofit Isolation\n\nThese options focus on specific pieces of equipment rather than the whole building.\n\nOption A (Key Parameter Measurement): Measures only the critical parameter (e.g., lighting operating hours) and estimates the others (e.g., fixture wattage).\n\nOption B (All Parameter Measurement): Measures all parameters (e.g., continuous metering of a VFD's power draw).\n\nAI Implementation: The AI focuses on subsystem modeling. For a chiller retrofit, it would model the $kW/ton$ vs. $Load$ curve. The baseline is the pre-retrofit efficiency curve; savings are the difference between the pre-retrofit curve applied to the current load and the actual measured power.11\n\n4. Project Standardization: Investor Confidence Project (ICP) Protocols\n\nTo bridge the gap between engineering calculations and financial underwriting, the AI model must adhere to the Investor Confidence Project (ICP) protocols. These protocols standardize the data requirements and documentation to reduce risk for investors.\n\n4.1 ICP Baselining Requirements\n\nICP mandates strict data sufficiency standards to ensure that baselines are robust. The AI model should implement a \"Data Quality Gate\" that rejects or flags datasets that do not meet these criteria.\n\nTier 1 vs. Tier 2 Requirements:\n\nData Duration: A minimum of 12 months of contiguous energy data is required. ICP recommends 36 months to capture year-on-year weather variability and anomalies.\n\nCoverage: The data must account for 100% of the energy sources for the building or the isolated system being retrofitted. The AI must check for gaps or missing fuel types (e.g., gas data present but electric missing).13\n\nIndependent Variables: The AI must ingest corresponding weather data (Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days) for the exact same interval as the energy data. It must also normalize for occupancy vacancy rates if they fluctuate.\n\nAlgorithm Validation: The model must verify that the regression statistics meet the ASHRAE G14 thresholds ($R^2 > 0.75$, CV-RMSE < 20% for baseline) before proceeding to savings calculation.13\n\n4.2 Standard Industry Practice (SIP) Baseline\n\nFor projects where a historical baseline is not appropriate (e.g., replacing a broken boiler at end-of-life), ICP and ASHRAE 90.1 mandate the use of a \"Standard Industry Practice\" (SIP) baseline.\n\nConcept: Savings are not calculated against the old broken boiler, but against a new standard-efficiency boiler that represents the market standard.\n\nAI Logic: The AI must distinguish between \"Early Replacement\" (savings vs. existing efficiency) and \"Burnout/End-of-Life\" (savings vs. code minimum efficiency). If the equipment age exceeds its useful life (e.g., >20 years for a boiler), the AI should default to the SIP baseline to avoid overstating savings.13\n\n5. Benchmarking and Reference Designs: ASHRAE Standard 90.1\n\nTo assess \"Potential for Energy Efficiency,\" the AI must compare the building's current performance against a theoretical ideal. ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G provides the rules for creating this \"Standard Reference Design\" (SRD).\n\n5.1 Baseline System Mapping (Appendix G)\n\nOne of the most complex heuristic tasks for the AI is determining the correct baseline HVAC system type. Appendix G Table G3.1.1-3 provides the mapping logic based on building type, size, and heating source.\n\nTable 1: ASHRAE 90.1 Baseline HVAC System Mapping Logic 14"

The AI must enforce the high-limit shutoff logic defined in ASHRAE 90.1 Table 6.5.1.1.3 to diagnose performance. The logic varies by Climate Zone, balancing the benefit of free cooling against the penalty of introducing humidity.\n\nTable 2: ASHRAE 90.1 Economizer High-Limit Shutoff Settings 15"

        "content": "All\n\n$h_{OA} > h_{RA}$ OR $T_{OA} > 75^\\circ\\text{F}$\n\nAI Logic: The model must ingest local weather data. For every hour where the facility requires cooling, the AI checks if the economizer should be active based on the Climate Zone rules above. If the meter data shows a high cooling load during these \"free cooling\" hours, the AI flags an \"Economizer Fault\" or \"Failed Damper.\" Note that Differential Enthalpy provides the highest theoretical efficiency but relies on humidity sensors that are prone to drift; the AI should prioritize Differential Dry Bulb diagnostics for robustness in drier climates.17\n\n5.3 Equipment Efficiency Standards\n\nThe AI must benchmark specific equipment performance against ASHRAE 90.1 Table 6.8.1 standards.\n\nChillers: Efficiency requirements are split into Path A (Full Load optimized) and Path B (Part Load/IPLV optimized). Path B is generally preferred for VFD-driven chillers in variable load buildings.\n\nExample Check: If a water-cooled centrifugal chiller (<300 tons) has an efficiency of 0.65 kW/ton, the AI compares this to the Path A standard (approx 0.61 kW/ton) and calculates the penalty.19\n\nBoilers: Efficiency is measured in Thermal Efficiency ($E_t$) or Combustion Efficiency ($E_c$). Gas boilers > 2,500,000 Btu/h typically require $E_c \\ge 80\\%$ or $E_c \\ge 82\\%$ depending on vintage.20\n\n6. Thermodynamic Constraints: Physics-Informed AI\n\nTo prevent \"hallucinations\" where the AI predicts physically impossible energy savings, the model must incorporate fundamental thermodynamic laws as hard constraints.\n\n6.1 Psychrometrics: The Energy of Air\n\nHVAC systems manage not just temperature (Sensible Heat) but also moisture (Latent Heat). The AI must calculate Enthalpy ($h$) to accurately model cooling coil loads."

The \"best model possible\" is one that:\n\nValidates itself using ASHRAE Guideline 14 statistics (NMBE/CV-RMSE).\n\nProtects itself from physical absurdity using Thermodynamic constraints (Psychrometrics/Affinity Laws).\n\nBenchmarks itself using ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G and CBECS 2018 data.\n\nStandardizes itself using ICP Protocols for data sufficiency and documentation.\n\nBy rigidly adhering to this framework, the AI transitions from a \"Black Box\" predictor to a \"Glass Box\" engineer—transparent, compliant, and capable of unlocking the massive energy efficiency potential dormant in the global building stock."

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used to solve for the intercepts ($\\beta_0$) and slopes ($\\beta_1, \\beta_2$).\n\nSelection Criterion: The model with the lowest CV-RMSE (Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error) is selected as the Baseline Model.$$CV(RMSE) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-p} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}}{\\bar{y}} \\times 100$$Where $n$ is the number of data points, $p$ is the number of parameters, $y_i$ is actual usage, $\\hat{y}_i$ is predicted usage, and $\\bar{y}$ is the mean usage.21\n\nA CV-RMSE below 20% for monthly data (or 30% for hourly data) typically indicates a model sufficiently robust for savings estimation.16 If the error is higher, the engine should flag the building as \"Non-Routine,\" possibly requiring human intervention or advanced Grey-Box modeling.\n\n3. Physics-Based Disaggregation: The \"Call Out\" Advantage\n\nWhile the statistical baseline determines the total weather-sensitive consumption, it lumps the HVAC load and the HVAC efficiency into a single slope parameter ($\\beta_1$). To estimate the savings from a technology upgrade (e.g., replacing a chiller), we must mathematically separate the Load (thermal demand) from the Efficiency (equipment performance). This separation is impossible with utility data alone; it requires physical priors. This is where the user input of \"System Type\" becomes the critical differentiator.\n\n3.1 Equipment Performance Curves\n\nDifferent HVAC technologies exhibit distinct efficiency profiles as a function of load and ambient conditions. By knowing the system type, the engine can map the statistical load profile to a specific efficiency curve, allowing for a much more precise calculation of the baseline thermal load.\n\n3.1.1 Chillers: The Impact of Lift and Load\n\nChillers are fundamentally different from DX units. Their efficiency is heavily dependent on \"Lift\"—the pressure difference between the condenser and evaporator.\n\nWater-Cooled Centrifugal Chillers: These units benefit significantly from \"relief.\" As the outdoor wet-bulb temperature drops, the cooling tower produces colder water, reducing lift and drastically improving efficiency (lowering kW/ton). They often operate most efficiently at 50-70% part load.2\n\nAir-Cooled Chillers: These are dependent on dry-bulb temperature and generally have lower peak efficiencies and different part-load degradation curves compared to water-cooled units.2\n\nThe mathematical model for a chiller in simulation engines like EnergyPlus is the Bi-Quadratic Curve 22:\n\n$$EIR = f(T_{chws}, T_{conds}, PLR)$$\n\nWhere $EIR$ (Energy Input Ratio) is the inverse of COP. The curve is a function of leaving chilled water temperature ($T_{chws}$), entering condenser water temperature ($T_{conds}$), and Part Load Ratio ($PLR$).\n\nWithout \"Call Out\": The engine must assume a linear degradation or a generic \"average\" curve.\n\nWith \"Call Out\": If the user selects \"Water-Cooled Chiller,\" the engine applies the DOE-2.1E generic centrifugal chiller curve. This curve might show that at 65°F outdoor temperature, the chiller is operating at 0.45 kW/ton. A generic curve might assume 1.0 kW/ton. This difference of >50% in the baseline assumption directly translates to a >50% error in the savings estimate for a new machine.\n\n3.1.2 Boilers: The Condensing Threshold\n\nBoiler efficiency is driven by the Return Water Temperature (RWT).\n\nNon-Condensing Boilers: These operate with RWT > 140°F to prevent flue gas condensation (which causes corrosion). Their efficiency is capped at roughly 80-82% and is relatively flat across part-load ratios.23\n\nCondensing Boilers: These are designed to operate with RWT < 130°F. When the water is cold enough to condense the flue gas, the latent heat of vaporization is recovered, boosting efficiency to 90-98%.25"

      {
        "heading": "The efficiency equation is:",
        "content": "$$Eff = Eff_{nom} \\times f(PLR) \\times f(RWT)$$\n\nWith \"Call Out\": If the user specifies \"Non-Condensing Boiler,\" the engine knows the baseline efficiency is likely ~80%. More importantly, it allows the engine to check the feasibility of a condensing retrofit. If the 3P-H regression shows a very steep heating slope ($\\beta_1$), implying high heating loads even at mild temperatures, the building may require high-temperature water, potentially limiting the savings from a condensing boiler unless the emitters (radiators/coils) are also upgraded.\n\n3.1.3 Rooftop Units (RTUs): Cycling and Economizers\n\nRTUs, particularly older constant-volume units, suffer from \"cycling losses\" at low loads. The compressor turns on and off to meet demand, which is inefficient compared to the variable modulation of a chiller or VRF system.\n\nPerformance Curve: RTU efficiency is typically modeled using EER and a Part Load Fraction (PLF) correlation 3:$$COP_{effective} = COP_{rated} \\times PLF(PLR)$$\n\nEconomizers: The \"Call Out\" allows the engine to ask about economizers. If the user selects \"RTU\" and the statistical baseline (4P model) shows a change-point at 55°F, the engine can infer that the economizer is either absent or broken (mechanical cooling is fighting free cooling). Fixing this is a low-cost, high-impact measure that the engine can recommend specifically because it identified the asset type.\n\n3.2 Mathematical Disaggregation Strategy\n\nThe process of using these curves to separate Load from Efficiency involves the following algorithm:\n\nDetermine Weather-Dependent Energy ($E_{wd}$): From the statistical baseline (e.g., 3P-C), calculate the daily cooling energy: $E_{wd} = \\beta_1 (T - \\beta_2)^+$.\n\nEstimate Hourly Load Profile: Use the \"Business Type\" (e.g., Office) to map the daily $E_{wd}$ to an hourly profile based on NREL ComStock operational schedules.4"

Data-Driven Research: Archetypes and Digital Twins\n\nTo fuel the physics-based models when user inputs are sparse, the engine requires a rich backend of \"Default Assumptions\" or \"Priors.\" This is where the research into public datasets becomes operational.\n\n4.1 Integrating NREL ComStock\n\nComStock is the premier dataset for US commercial building energy modeling. It contains roughly 350,000 energy models representing the diversity of the national building stock.4 The \"End-Use Load Profiles\" dataset, derived from ComStock, provides 15-minute calibrated load profiles for every building type and climate zone.27"

The bucket structure is s3://oedi-data-lake/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/.29\n\nArchetype Extraction: The engine should pre-process this data to create a \"Digital Twin Lookup Table.\"\n\nKeys: Building Type (e.g., Retail), Climate Zone (e.g., 3A), Vintage (Pre-1980, Post-2004).\n\nValues: Normalized HVAC EUI (kWh/ft²), HVAC-to-Baseload Ratio, Typical Operating Schedule.\n\nApplication: When a user uploads data for a \"Restaurant in Atlanta\" but provides no other details, the engine queries the ComStock table. It finds that the median HVAC load for this archetype is 45% of total electric. It uses this ratio to \"sanity check\" the statistical baseline derived from the customer's meter. If the regression says 10% HVAC, the engine flags a potential anomaly (e.g., broken meter, 24/7 operation).\n\n4.2 DOE Commercial Reference Buildings\n\nWhile ComStock provides the load profiles, the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings provide the equipment specifications. These are 16 EnergyPlus models that represent standard construction practices.31"

When a user says \"I have a Chiller\" but doesn't know the model, the engine defaults to the curve from the \"Large Office Reference Building\" for that climate zone. This ensures the baseline efficiency assumption is compliant with ASHRAE 90.1 standards for that vintage.\n\n4.3 CBECS for Probabilistic Inference\n\nThe Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) provides statistical distributions of equipment types.33\n\nBayesian Priors: If the user does not call out the system type, CBECS data allows the engine to calculate probabilities.\n\nFact: 50,000 sqft Office in NY (Zone 4A).\n\nCBECS Probability: 20% chance of Chiller, 70% chance of RTU, 10% chance of Heat Pump.\n\nEngine Logic: The engine can calculate savings for both a Chiller and an RTU scenario and present a weighted average range: \"Estimated Savings: $5,000 - $8,000 (depending on system type).\" This transparency builds trust with the user.\n\n5. Leveraging Historical Data: The k-Nearest Neighbors Approach\n\nThe request mentions \"using our past project data.\" This is a critical asset for closing the \"Performance Gap\"—the difference between theoretical savings (physics models) and realized savings. To operationalize this, we recommend a Case-Based Reasoning system using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) clustering.\n\n5.1 The k-NN Algorithm\n\nk-NN is a non-parametric method that predicts the value of a new point based on the values of the $k$ closest training examples in the feature space.35"

        "content": "Feature Vector Construction: Every past project $P$ and the new customer building $C$ are represented as vectors of normalized features:$$V =$$\n\nNorm_EUI: Annual kWh / SqFt.\n\nHDD/CDD Intensity: Total degree days for the location.\n\nLoad Factor: Average Demand / Peak Demand (captures \"peaky\" vs. flat profiles).\n\nBusiness Type: One-hot encoded (e.g., for School).\n\nDistance Calculation: Calculate the Euclidean Distance (or Cosine Similarity) between the new customer $C$ and all past projects $P_i$:$$D(C, P_i) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^m w_j (C_j - P_{i,j})^2}$$Weights ($w_j$) are critical. \"Business Type\" and \"Climate Zone\" should be heavily weighted to ensure an Office in Florida isn't compared to a Warehouse in Maine.38\n\nRetrieval & Calibration: Identify the 5 nearest neighbors ($k=5$). Retrieve their Realized Savings Rates for relevant measures.\n\nExample: The math model predicts 25% savings for a Chiller upgrade.\n\nk-NN Result: The 5 most similar past projects achieved an average of 18% savings.\n\nAdjustment: The engine applies a \"Realization Factor\" of $18/25 = 0.72$ to the physics-based estimate, presenting a \"Calibration-Adjusted\" savings number that reflects real-world operational friction (e.g., overrides, maintenance issues).\n\n5.2 Implementation in Python\n\nThe scikit-learn library is the standard tool for this.40\n\nPreprocessing: Use StandardScaler to normalize features (mean=0, variance=1) so that large numbers (SqFt) don't dominate small numbers (Load Factor).\n\nClustering: Use sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.\n\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW): For advanced implementation, compare the shapes of the load profiles directly using DTW. This measures similarity between temporal sequences which may vary in speed or phase.41 A building with a \"Morning Warm-up\" spike will naturally cluster with other buildings having that spike, ensuring that operational schedules are matched.\n\n6. Implementation Architecture: The Tech Stack\n\nTo bring this \"math and research\" to life, a robust software architecture is required. The Python ecosystem is uniquely suited for this due to its dominance in both energy modeling and data science.\n\n6.1 Core Libraries\n\neeweather: 20\n\nFunction: Automatic mapping of lat/long to the nearest reliable NOAA weather station (ISD/GSOD). It handles data cleaning, gap filling, and normalization.\n\nWhy: Eliminates the manual step of finding weather files.\n\neemeter: 19\n\nFunction: The Open Energy Efficiency Meter. It is the reference implementation of the CalTrack (ASHRAE G14) methods. It automates the grid search for 3P/4P/5P models and calculates uncertainty metrics.\n\nWhy: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use the industry-standard open-source calculation engine.\n\nscikit-learn: 40\n\nFunction: Implements the k-NN clustering and regression algorithms.\n\nWhy: Robust, scalable machine learning.\n\npandas & numpy:\n\nFunction: High-performance time-series manipulation. Resampling 15-minute interval data to hourly or daily resolution for regression.\n\n6.2 Grey-Box Modeling (Advanced Option)\n\nFor users who provide high-frequency interval data (15-minute), the engine can deploy Grey-Box (RC) Models.44\n\nConcept: The building is modeled as an electrical circuit (Resistors = Insulation, Capacitors = Thermal Mass).\n\nEquation: A 2R1C model (2 Resistors, 1 Capacitor):$$C \\frac{dT_{in}}{dt} = \\frac{T_{out} - T_{in}}{R_{ea}} + Q_{sun} + Q_{int} + Q_{HVAC}$$\n\nSolution: Use scipy.optimize to find the parameter set $\\{R, C\\}$ that minimizes the error between the modeled and actual internal temperature (or load).47\n\nValue: This separates the envelope performance from the HVAC performance. It allows the app to answer: \"What if I improve insulation?\" vs \"What if I replace the HVAC?\" independently, which pure statistical regression cannot do.\n\n6.3 Application Workflow\n\nIngestion: App accepts GreenButton XML or CSV.\n\nValidation: Check for data sufficiency (minimum 12 months).\n\nContextualization: eeweather pulls coincident weather data.\n\nInverse Modeling: eemeter runs CalTrack methods to derive $\\beta$ coefficients (Baseline Model)."

Conclusion\n\nThe integration of an HVAC savings estimator requires a sophisticated orchestration of statistical methods and physical data. The answer to the user's core query is unequivocal: Yes, calling out the system type is crucial. It acts as the bridge between the observable (utility bill) and the actionable (equipment retrofit). Without it, the system is blind to the specific physics of the savings opportunity.\n\nBy adopting the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Architecture outlined above, the app can provide estimates that are not merely \"rough guesses\" but are scientifically defensible, rooted in ASHRAE standards, and calibrated by the ground truth of historical projects. This approach minimizes user friction through intelligent defaults (ComStock) while rewarding detailed inputs with higher-precision outputs, creating a scalable engine for energy efficiency discovery.\n\n8.

Fan speed modulates based on duct static pressure.\n\n6.3 VAV Equations ZoneLoad = cfm_zone × 1.08 × (SAT − SpaceTemp)\n\nWhere: cfm_zone = airflow delivered to zone SAT = supply air temperature 1.08 = constant (air density × specific heat × minutes)\n\n6.4 VAV Fan Power FanPower ∝ Flow^3\n\nIf airflow reduced by 20%: Power drops by (0.8)^3 = 0.512 (≈ 50% reduction)\n\n6.5 VAV Reheat ReheatLoad = cfm_min × 1.08 × (SpaceTemp − SAT)\n\nWhere cfm_min is minimum airflow required by ASHRAE or system needs.\n\n6.6 VAV Savings Mechanisms Resetting SAT reduces reheat therms. Resetting static pressure reduces fan power. Ventilation tuning reduces cooling and heating load. Better scheduling reduces fan run hours.\n\n6.7 AI must determine baseline: Minimum airflow ratio (typical 30% of design) Duct static pressure setpoint (e.g., 1.5” wc) SAT setpoint (e.g., 55°F) Operating schedule\n\n6.8 VAV Optimization Savings FanSavings_VAV = BaselineFanPower − NewFanPower Where NewFanPower = BaselineFanPower × (SP_new/SP_old)^(3/2)\n\nReheatSavings_VAV = BaselineReheat − NewReheat\n\nSATResetSavings ≈ 5–15% cooling reduction StaticPressureResetSavings ≈ 10–30% fan reduction"
