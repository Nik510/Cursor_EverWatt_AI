        "content": "1.1 Purpose This manual defines the engineering logic and mathematical methods required to model lighting energy use, lighting retrofit savings, lighting controls impacts, HVAC-lumens interactions, ballast behavior, fixture mapping, and end-use interactions. It provides rules for how AI must identify baseline lighting loads, predict retrofit savings, and produce consistent financial outcomes based on lighting improvements.\n\n1.2 What Lighting Modeling Supports ESCO-grade project scoping Retrofit package creation Lighting audit estimation Lighting-to-HVAC interaction modeling Daylighting synergy Controls evaluation Financial savings and incentive evaluation Multimeasure stacking with battery, HVAC, and controls Lighting schedules inference Interior + exterior lighting identification\n\n1.3 AI Behavior Requirements AI must: Never hallucinate fixture types or wattage Request missing fixture counts or area sizes when critical Follow deterministic engineering relationships Respect ballast behavior Prevent unrealistic savings (>75% whole-facility unless proven) Apply HVAC interaction adjustments correctly Use climate zone guidance for lighting-HVAC coupling Be conservative when hours-of-operation uncertain Explain all reasoning in text\n\n------------------------------------------------------------"

        "content": "------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1 Hours of Operation (HOO) Hours greatly affect savings. AI must estimate HOO when not provided using building type:\n\nOffice interior: 50–70 hours/week School interior: 40–60 hours/week Hospital: 24/7 for critical areas Warehouse: 2-shift or 3-shift depending on operation Retail interiors: 70–100 hours/week Exterior lights: dusk-to-dawn (~4,000–4,500 hours/year)\n\n3.2 Inferring Hours from Interval Data AI must detect lighting baseload in interval data: If nighttime usage > daytime-off usage → exterior load If early morning spikes with occupancy → interior lights If flat baseload at night → mixed HVAC/lighting if warehouse or industrial\n\n3.3 Schedule-Based Hours If schedule known: HOO = occupied_hours × lighting_profile_factor\n\n3.4 Conservatism Rules If hours uncertain, AI must assume lower hours to avoid overstated savings. AI must not assume 4,000 hours/year for interiors unless specified.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------"

        "content": "------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.1 Basic Lighting Energy Equation LightingEnergy = FixturePower × Hours × FixtureCount\n\nWhere FixturePower = input watts including ballast losses.\n\n4.2 Ballast Factor Fluorescent wattages vary with ballast. Actual fluorescent power = NominalWattage × BallastFactor BallastFactor = 0.77–1.18 depending on ballast type.\n\nAI must adjust fluorescent wattage accordingly.\n\n4.3 LED Driver Power LED wattage includes: LED electrical load Driver conversion loss Thermal losses\n\nAI must assume typical LED driver efficiency = 85–90%.\n\n4.4 Fixture Efficacy Efficacy = lumens per watt AI may use efficacy ratios to determine lumen equivalence but must not mix lumen modeling with energy modeling unless doing daylighting analysis.\n\n4.5 Interactive Effects (HVAC Impact) Lighting produces heat. Reducing lighting reduces cooling load but increases heating load in some climates.\n\nCoolingInteractionSavings (kWh) = LightingEnergyReduction × CoolingFraction × HVAC_COP_Adjustment\n\nHeatingInteractionPenalty (therms) = LightingEnergyReduction × HeatingFraction / BoilerEfficiency\n\nAI must estimate cooling and heating fractions based on climate zone and building type.\n\n4.6 Whole-Building Savings AI must apply interactive adjustment:\n\nNetElectricSavings = LightingSavings_kWh − HeatingPenalty_kWh_equivalent\n\nCoolingReduction_kWh\n\nNetThermSavings = LightingThermPenaltyReduction\n\nRULE: Lighting retrofit always reduces kWh Heating therms may increase depending on climate\n\n------------------------------------------------------------"

Interactive heating penalties must be applied last.\n\nTotalSavings = LightingRetrofitSavings\n\nControlsSavings(onNewLoad)\n\nCoolingInteractionSavings − HeatingPenalty\n\n7.2 Exterior + Interior Bundling Exterior savings unaffected by interior hours.
